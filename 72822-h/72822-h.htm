Joseph Joachim Raff, was the
son of an organist and teacher,
Franz Joseph Raff, who early in
1822 left the little Würtemberg city
of Weisenstetter in the Horb district
of the Black Forest to settle in Lachen on
the lake of Zurich in the canton Schwyz. Here on
May 27 of the same year the boy was born. In
his early childhood he displayed that mental
ability which does not always fulfill its promise
in years of maturity. He was able to translate
Homer at the age of seven and generally preferred
books to rude outdoor sports. He displayed
musical tendencies, too, learning to play the organ
and to sing in the choir; but no special attention
was given to his musical training, probably because
his facility in this art was regarded as only an evidence
of his general activity of mind. He was
first put to school at the Würtemberg Institute,
and after a thorough preparation there, was sent
to the Schwyz Jesuit Lyceum. He was graduated
with distinction, carrying off prizes in Latin and
mathematics, but his means were not sufficient to
enable him to take a university course. He obtained
the post of tutor of Latin at St. Gallen,
where he remained a short time, afterward going
as a teacher to Rapperswyl. He was at this time
hardly twenty years of age. He now began his
study of music, for which his fondness had been
growing. He was unable to afford a teacher, but
he diligently practised at the piano and made
many earnest attempts at composition.</p>

<p class='c007'>The patron saint of musical Germany in 1842
was Mendelssohn and in August of that year he set
off on one of his tours in Switzerland. No date is
recorded, but we may be sure that Raff seized upon
this visit as his opportunity. Mendelssohn, with
his customary promptness in recognizing and assisting
aspirants, gave the young man a warm
letter of recommendation to the great publishing
house of Breitkopf &#38; Härtel. So effective were the
master’s words that Raff’s first work was published
in January, 1843. Thenceforward the current of
his life could not be checked, and despite the
opposition of his parents, he devoted his future to
music. No critical notice of Raff’s opus 1 has
been found, but opus 2 (“Trois Pièces Caracteristique”
for piano) is mentioned with kindness in
Schumann’s journal, the <cite><span lang="de">Neue Zeitschrift für Musik</span></cite>,
of Aug. 5, 1844. The critic found in the composition
“something which points to a future for the
composer.” One readily discerns here the keen
insight of the greatest of all music critics, Schumann
himself. Favorable comments were made on the
young composer’s works numbered opus 2 to 6 in
the <cite><span lang="de">Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung</span></cite> of Aug. 21 in
the same year, and we may readily understand that
with such encouragements Raff bent his whole mind
to the production of music.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1845 the wizard Liszt appeared in Switzerland.
The great pianist was not long in discovering Raff’s
gifts and was equally quick to see that the young
man was struggling against privations that would
have overwhelmed a weaker nature. Liszt invited
Raff to accompany him on a concert tour, and thus
laid the foundations of the beginner’s reputation.
Together they travelled in the principal German
cities, the tour ending at Cologne. Thence Liszt
returned to Paris, but Raff remained. This stay in
Cologne was a happy one, for it led to a personal
acquaintance with Mendelssohn. The famous
master, who had given the young composer his
first help, now displayed fresh interest in him and
made him a proposition to go to Leipsic and continue
his studies under Mendelssohn’s own guidance.
Such an offer was not to be refused, but the fates
were not propitious. Just as Raff was making his
preparations to go to Leipsic in the fall of 1847
Mendelssohn’s untimely death put an end to his
hopes. He had not been idle while in Cologne,
however, for he had studied composition with great
earnestness, and had sent to the <cite>Cäcilia</cite>, published
in Berlin by the noted contrapuntist, Siegfried
Dehn, many contributions displaying wide knowledge
of musical science. Later he published “Die
Wagnerfrage” (“The Wagner Question”), a pamphlet
which attracted much attention, as did all
discussions of the works of the Bayreuth genius.</p>

<p class='c007'>Raff now became anxious to make a permanent
home for himself in one of the larger German cities.
He appealed once more to Liszt, who gave him a
letter of introduction to Mechetti, at that time a
prominent publisher of Vienna. It seemed as if ill
luck relentlessly pursued Raff, for while he was
actually on the way to visit Mechetti, the latter
died. In spite of such obstacles to his advancement
the composer continued his labors with
undaunted spirit. He returned to his old home at
Würtemberg and resumed his studies. For a short
time he taught and studied at Stuttgart, seeking in
the latter city to fill the gaps in his early training.
That his ambition was unconquered is well proved
by the fact that in Stuttgart he wrote his first large
work, an opera in four acts entitled “King Alfred.”
In Stuttgart, too, he was in some measure recompensed
for his many trials and adversities by
making the acquaintance of one who was destined
to be his life-long friend and his champion after
death. This was Hans von Bülow, then a youth of
barely twenty, not yet the famous pupil of Liszt,
but a law student who was neglecting his studies
for the pursuit of music. Von Bülow, no doubt,
perceived that to introduce to the public a new
composer of merit would add to his own success as
a player, and he accordingly performed from memory
a recently finished composition of Raff’s, which
he had seen for the first time two days before.
The result was a storm of applause for both player
and composer. This success cemented the friendship
of the two, and, as all who have often heard
the pianist well know, Dr. von Bülow very rarely
plays a miscellaneous programme on which the
name of Raff does not appear.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was in 1850 that the young man met Liszt
again, this time in Hamburg, and followed the
magnet of attraction to Weimar. Here at last
it seemed as if Raff had found the atmosphere for
which his spirit hungered. Music, literature and
art permeated the air; and the foreign artists who
came to lay their tributes of flattery before the
throne of the musical idol of the hour had smiles
of approval for Raff, who basked in the sunlight
and let the essence of the new German ideas in
music saturate his soul. He went to work with
renewed vigor, and inspired by the presence of
competent performers wrote his first chamber music
(Quatuor No. 1 in D minor for strings), some of
his best piano suites, his setting of Geibel’s “Traum
König und Sein Lieb” (“Dream King and his
Love”), “Wachet auf” and other well known works.
Raff made himself popular and respected in the
artistic circles of Weimar by his learning. When
Berlioz, who was ignorant of German, was there
and a banquet was given in his honor, Raff relieved
the situation of some difficulty by making the
address to the guest in Latin, an attention which
highly delighted the Frenchman.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime Raff had found his domestic fate
in Doris Genast, an actress, grand-daughter of
Goethe’s favorite actor. This young lady having
accepted an engagement in Wiesbaden, the composer
followed her thither in 1856. He speedily
became the most popular music teacher in the city,
but his compositions still failed to find a ready
market. Nevertheless he employed his spare hours
unceasingly in writing. In 1859 he and Fräulein
Genast were married, and a daughter was the result
of their union. Previous to his marriage he composed
in 1858 his second violin sonata and the
incidental music to “Bernhard von Weimar,” a
drama by Wilhelm Genast. The overture to this
drama became a favorite and was played frequently
in many parts of Germany. In the summer of 1859,
however, he began the work which was to establish
his fame. This was his first symphony, “In the
Fatherland.” It was ready for the publisher in
1861, when the composer was informed of the prize
offered by the “Society of the Friends of Music of
the Austrian Empire” (“Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde”),
for the best symphony offered in
competition. Raff sent in his new work, and in
1863 a committee consisting of Ferdinand Hiller,
Carl Reinecke, Dr. Ambros, Robert Volkmann and
Vincenz Lachner adjudged it the best of thirty-two
compositions. Other large works followed, and their
success enabled him to give up teaching to devote
himself wholly to composing. No artist’s life shows
more plainly than Raff’s the result of escape from
poverty’s iron control. Hitherto he had written
copiously for the drawing-room, but now he sought
to produce works wholly artistic in purpose. His
retirement after the beginning of the year 1870 was
almost idyllic, being broken only by the visits of
fellow artists. It is impossible to agree with the
oft-repeated statement that his best works date
from this period, for the beautiful “Im Walde”
(“In the Forest”) symphony appeared in 1869;
but there is every proof of a higher purpose in the
compositions after 1870 than in the majority of
those originating earlier than that year. Perhaps,
too, Raff’s lack of business ability may be accepted
as an evidence of his artistic sincerity. For his
first, second and fourth symphonies he received no
cash payment; for the third (“Im Walde”) he got
sixty thalers, the same amount being paid him again,
when the work was sold to a French publisher.
Thereafter, however, he seems to have acquired
courage enough to ask fair prices for his works.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1877 Raff left Wiesbaden to become director
of the new Conservatory of Music at Frankfort.
He taught composition himself, arranged the
library, and conducted the institution upon such a
broad-minded plan that its success was assured from
the beginning. He continued his labors in composition,
his symphonies after the seventh, having
been written at Frankfort together with other
important works. Ignorant of the fact that a
mortal disease had fastened upon him he worked
with undiminished zeal till 1882, when on the night
of June 24, heart disease ended his career.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to these principal works there is a
great mass of chamber music, piano compositions,
songs and ’cello pieces.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may, perhaps, be unfortunate for Raff’s fame
that his dramatic works are unknown in this country,
though it is indisputable that none of them has
achieved high repute in German. It is probable,
although we in America know far less about the
music of this gifted man than the Germans do, the
estimate of his abilities generally accepted on this
side of the Atlantic is a wise one. He is regarded
as a composer who, possessing exceptional fecundity
of melodic invention and rare mastery of
orchestral tone-color, sought to impose upon music
a definiteness of expression somewhat beyond its
power. This eagerness to delineate in detail a
chain of feelings or impressions led Raff into
diffuseness of style and to frequent sacrifices of
those formal elaborations which are regarded as
essential to the construction of artistic music. He
has been generally thought to lack self-criticism
and a want of restraint resulting therefrom; but
it has always seemed to the present writer that
Raff’s errors were not in the direction of criticism,
but of fundamental belief. In other words he let
the beautiful vision of a genus of pictorial programme
music which is to be more expressive
than speech run away with his reason. The
preface to his “In the Fatherland” symphony
clearly exhibits his idea of the possibilities of music.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now it is neither necessary nor expedient to
repeat here any of the familiar discussion as to the
expressive power of music. The most serious
thinkers about the art, even when they disagree in
details, are generally of the opinion that music can
express only the broader emotions, and requires
text to make clear the cause of the feelings. We
are able to get great pleasure, and at times genuine
emotional exaltation from the music of Raff provided
we are willing to approach it in the only fair
spirit in which programme music can be approached—that
of willingness to accept the composer’s
premises. The first movement of the “Fatherland”
symphony has strength and aspiration, and we have
only to accept Raff’s explanation that he is singing
of Germany to enter into the heart of his composition.
In the same way we are obliged to approach
the “Lenore,” the “Im Walde” and his other
symphonies. The grisly story of Burger’s “Lenore”
is told in detail in the finale of the symphony, but
in order to follow the music we need the poem.
Having that, we perceive the aptness and peculiar
fitness of the composer’s rhythmic and melodic
fancies. Nothing could have a more stimulating
effect upon the imagination—once the key to the
secret is possessed—than the inexorable persistence
of the groups of a quaver and two semi-quavers
by which the infernal flight of the lovers
is indicated. If perchance we find an instrumental
representation of a gallop not new (it having been
invented by Claudio Monteverde in the beginning
of the seventeenth century) we can at any rate get all
the effect designed by Raff in his woodwind
shrieks of the nightbirds and his trombone hymn
for the dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>He has achieved a greater fidelity of feeling and
a subtler realism of tones, however, in his “Im
Walde,” which is generally looked upon as his
masterpiece. The first movement is intended to
bring to the hearer’s mind the woods in the sunlit
beauty of noon. The second reveals them to us in
the suggestive shadow of twilight. In the third
movement the composer entertains us with an airy
and delicate dance of Dryads, a woodland scherzo
in deed and in truth. In the fourth and last
movement we have a musical embodiment of the
familiar German legend of the Wild Huntsman. A
gentle fugal thought pictures the repose of the
woods. Suddenly the rhythm of the galloping hunt
is heard, as it were, in the distance. Nearer and
nearer it comes, till the whole orchestra thunders
with its riotous fury. It dies away in the distance,
returns and dies away again. Then comes the
glory of sunrise. This symphony makes less demands
in the way of preparation than many of Raff’s
other works. The single suggestion that he is
painting the forest and that there is a wild hunt is
all that the imagination needs to give it complete
enjoyment of this work. Freedom of form is a
natural result of the kind of composition in which
Raff excelled and his ability to write quickly and
with little effort prevented his feeling the necessity
of working out his compositions with the care and
science of the classical school. One gets much
less intellectual satisfaction, therefore, out of Raff’s
work than out of Schumann’s, who was his precursor,
and still less than out of Mozart’s. But the ear and
the imagination are delighted by the clear intelligibility
of his melodic ideas, their unfailing poetic sentiment
and musical grace. It is these qualities of
his themes, together with the splendid colors in
which his orchestral palette is so rich, that have
given to his symphonic works their wide popularity,
and have made the name of Raff recognized as that
of one of the really gifted followers of the romantic
school founded by Schumann and Schubert. In
the general outline his symphonies follow the laws
of the earlier masters, notably in the distribution
of the movements. His separate movements, however,
are not always built according to the old
rules, his finales being notably free and irregular.
It can only be said, then, in concluding this brief
estimate of his symphonic writing, that his works in
the large orchestral form are admirable examples
of that class of modern composition in which
structural skill and scientific development are sacrificed
to warmth of sentiment and opulence of color.
In a word, they belong to what may be called
the impressionist school of music.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lest it be supposed that Raff was deficient in
musical learning, let us note that his chamber music,
always melodious and graceful, frequently displays
profound mastery of the resources of his art. His
sextet in G minor, opus 178, deserves especial
mention because it is one of his most carefully
written productions. It is written for two violins,
two violas and two ’cellos in six real parts, and every
trick of canon and imitation is introduced. One
commentator enthusiastically describes it as “a
veritable triumph of counterpoint.” In his treatment
of the first subject of his “In the Fatherland”
symphony, too, he writes a canon in augmentation
and double augmentation that would have delighted
the eye of Bach himself. Dr. Franz Gehring, of
Vienna, in his article on Raff in Grove’s “Dictionary
of Music” calls attention to the interesting fact
that “in the pianoforte concerto in C minor (opus
185) in each movement all the subjects are in
double counterpoint with one another, yet this is
one of Raff’s freshest and most melodious works.”
The composer’s piano music is very popular, and
some of it, notably the variations on an original
theme (opus 179) and most of the suites, is remarkable
for its fertility of resource as well as for
the composer’s usual readiness for the production
of new melodies. His songs are equally rich in
tunefulness and many of them have attained the
rare distinction of becoming the common property
of the German people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Raff may not deserve a seat among the Titans of
music. Yet his originality, his grace of thought
and his oriental gorgeousness of utterance lift him
above the level of mediocrity and stamp him as a
man possessed of rare and valuable gifts. His
larger works show every evidence of artistic earnestness,
and had he been less imbued with
impressionistic ideas and more free from the
burdens of poverty, he might have attained perfection
of art.</p>

The spirit of modern civilization is
preëminently a critical one. A vast
amount of knowledge and talent
is constantly put in its service and
it seems as though education had
no higher purpose than to enable man to become
as early as possible a critic of everything
offered for material or spiritual use or enjoyment.
In no field have these tendencies become more conspicuous
than in the most delicate and complicated
art of music. Our generation is brought up not so
much for a life-long devotion, study and true appreciation,
as for a most premature forming and
uttering of opinions as to the merits, and particularly
the shortcomings, of any production. Most
of our critics, too, work in this wrong direction, instead
of preaching that modesty and prudence and
earnest devotion which alone enables us to become
familiar with new talent or works of a higher order.
Goethe accuses critics in general, that they have the
habit of ignoring really great things and of showing
an unusual interest in mediocrity. He ascribes to
them a bad influence upon creative artists, saying
that these can only follow the path dictated by
their nature, while arrogant criticism, which assumes
to prescribe to them how to do or not to do a thing,
may destroy them. He doubts whether in modern
England, with the criticising daily press, such an
astounding appearance as that of a Shakespeare
would be possible, and, as an expert, declares that
great things can be accomplished only in a state of
absolutely undisturbed, innocent, almost somnambulistic
creation, attained by complete isolation. That
such self-chosen isolation, resting upon a strong
personal and artistic character, yet combined with a
hearty interest in all human concerns and the most
comprehensive general culture, is possible, even in
our modern time, and that it can be crowned with
most wonderful results, is splendidly shown by the
career of Johannes Brahms, whose greatness rests
mainly on this unswerving fidelity to his genius in
spite of all adverse criticism during the years of his
development and attained mastership.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was born in Hamburg, May 7th, 1833, being
the eldest of three children of Johann Brahms, a
remarkable musician, who played double bass at the
theatre, and Christiane Nissen, a lady of an affectionate,
noble character. There was never a doubt as
to his becoming a musician. Under the instruction
first of O. Cossel and, from his tenth year, of Eduard
Marxsen, a most thorough musician and excellent
teacher in the sister city Altona, the boy made rapid
progress on the piano. Marxsen soon began also to
give him theoretical instruction and was at once
attracted by the rare keenness of the intellect of his
pupil. Indeed, in his first productions he recognized
a spirit which convinced him of a profound
latent talent. He therefore spared no effort to
awaken and guide this talent that his pupil might
become another priest of art to “preach in a new
way what is high, true and imperishable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As a lad of fourteen Brahms played for the first
time in public, pieces of his favorite masters, Bach
and Beethoven, and original variations on a folk-song,
thus showing an early liking not only for
popular melodies, but for a musical form which he
has cultivated more assiduously and for higher purposes
than any other modern composer. Indeed this
combination of popular elements with most artistic
and complicated forms has perhaps remained the
most characteristic feature of Brahms’ music.</p>

<p class='c007'>After giving a few other concerts, Marxsen kept
him for several years from appearing in public,
until in 1853 he could send him as a master of his instrument
upon his first journey with the Hungarian
violin virtuoso Remenyi. In Hanover, where he
played much before the king, he met Joachim, who
became his life-long friend, and Joachim was especially
impressed when Brahms, in one of these concerts
with Remenyi, transposed on account of the low
pitch of the piano, without any preparation and even
without notes, a Beethoven violin sonata, raising it a
semitone. Marxsen was not surprised; for years
Brahms had been accustomed to transpose great
pieces at sight into any key, and so astonishing was
his memory, that he never carried notes with him
upon a concert trip. The compositions of Beethoven
and Bach and a long list of modern concert pieces
were safely committed to memory by him. Brahms
remained several weeks in Weimar as the guest of
Liszt, who delighted in playing the young composer’s
manuscripts. Then he parted from Remenyi and
went with Joachim’s recommendation to Robert
Schumann in Düsseldorf. The impression which his
personality, playing, and works made upon the latter
was profound. Nothing in his later career, rich in
honors and triumphs, can be dearer to his memory
than the enthusiastic greeting with which Schumann
introduced him to the musical world.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without some citation from an oft-reprinted article
in the “Neue Zeitschrift für Musik” no sketch of
Brahms’ life is complete. Schumann greets him as
the one whom he had expected to appear to utter the
highest ideal expression of his times, claiming the
mastership not by a gradual development, but appearing
suddenly before us fully equipped as Minerva
sprang from the brain of Jupiter. “And he has
come, a youth at whose cradle graces and heroes
kept watch.” “Sitting at the piano he began to unveil
wonderful regions. We were drawn into more
and more magical circles by his playing, full of
genius, which made of the piano an orchestra of
lamenting and jubilant voices. There were sonatas,
or rather veiled symphonies; songs, whose poetry
might be understood without words; piano pieces
both of a demoniac nature and of the most graceful
form; sonatas for violin and piano—string
quartets—each so different from every other, that
they seemed to flow from many different springs.”
“Whenever he bends his magic wand, there, when
the powers of orchestra and chorus lend him their
aid, further glimpses of the ideal world will be revealed
to us. May the highest genius strengthen
him; meanwhile the spirit of modesty dwells within
him. His comrades greet him at his first step
into the world of art, where wounds may perhaps
await him, but bay and laurel also; we welcome
him as a valiant warrior.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This cordial introduction created quite a sensation,
yet it was by no means a guaranty of an
enthusiastic reception of the young composer’s
works. For, far from being an imitator of Schumann’s
style, he appeared at once in his own strong
personality and as a stranger, who even in Leipsic
was not understood. Yet he found publishers for
three pianoforte sonatas, a scherzo, a trio and
several songs. For years the interest in him was
confined to a small circle. He stayed for a while
in Hanover, making from there several concert
tours with Joachim or Stockhausen, the great singer,
another devoted friend, visiting also Schumann in
his retreat in the Endenich hospital. In his variations
on a theme from Schumann’s Op. 99, he gave a
touching expression to his sympathy with the master’s
sufferings. After the publication of these and
the ballads Op. 10, Brahms devoted several years
to profound study. Schumann’s praise had not
spoiled him, nor was he discouraged by the lack of
success. For a few seasons he was the director
of the orchestra and chorus in Detmold, spending
also some time in Hamburg and in travelling.
Meanwhile he finished many songs and choruses, two
serenades for orchestra, and two sextets. In Jan.,
1859, he played in Leipsic his first great pianoforte
concerto; most of the criticisms thereon were, however,
such as to now excite our mirth. It was in Switzerland
and Vienna that his genius found a sincere
recognition. About thirty years ago the writer first
saw Brahms in his Swiss home; at that time he was
of a rather delicate slim-looking figure, with a
beardless face of ideal expression. Since then he
has changed in appearance, until now he looks the
very image of health, being stout and muscular, the
noble, manly face surrounded by a full gray beard.
The writer well remembers singing under his direction,
watching him conduct orchestra rehearsals,
hearing him play alone or with orchestra, listening
to an after-dinner speech or private conversation,
observing him when attentively listening to other
works, and seeing the modest smile with which he
accepted, or rather declined, expressions of admiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Alpine summits and glaciers had great attractions
for Brahms, but also the welcome which he was
always sure to find in Basel and Zürich. For his
permanent home he selected Vienna, in 1862, where
he was surrounded by the spirits of the classic masters.
He was received most favorably. His interpretation
of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert and
Schumann was particularly praised. He was appointed
chorus master of the Sing-Academie for a
season, and prepared a memorable performance of
Bach’s Passion Music. Yet his genius would not
allow him to devote much time to such services, and
once only in later years he accepted a similar appointment,
directing from 1872–1875 the concerts
of the “Society of the Friends of Music.” Aside
from this all his time was devoted to composing, interrupted
only by frequent journeys to performances
of his works, and by giving valuable assistance in
the revision of the works of Couperin, Mozart
and Chopin. During the first years of his residence
in Vienna he finished many important chamber
works, variations, waltzes and
Hungarian dances for the
pianoforte, and vocal compositions
of every kind. The
first great success was won
by the “German Requiem,”
begun after the death of his
mother in 1866, and completed,
for the greater part,
in Switzerland, in the two
following years. After the
first famous performance in
the Bremen Cathedral in the
spring of 1868, it was soon
heard in other cities and was
greatly admired, although
certain features were severely
criticised. Other works of
high importance followed: the
“Song of Destiny,” “Rinaldo,”
the “Rhapsody,” Op. 53,
the “Song of Triumph” for
the celebration of the happy
ending of the Franco-German war, besides many
songs, chamber works, and the charming Love-Song
Waltzes. By all these works Brahms rose
gradually higher and higher in the general estimation
both at home and abroad. But he steadfastly
avoided the one field in the reform of which all
musical interest seemed to centre,—the opera.
Perhaps the time will come when we may be fully
informed as to his relation to dramatic music and the
reasons which kept him away from the stage. Much
might be guessed. But it is needless to pay attention
to mere rumors and suppositions. There were
other fields in which he was called upon to achieve
great things. Nothing shows better the greatness of
Brahms’ artistic character than the fact that, in spite
of Schumann’s prophecy and many early instrumental
masterpieces, he waited with his first symphony
until he was a man of over forty years. Four great
symphonies have appeared between 1876 and 1885,
preceded by orchestral variations on a theme of
Haydn; also, during the same time, two overtures,
a second pianoforte concerto, one for violin, two
smaller choruses with orchestra, chamber works,
piano pieces and songs. Another great choral
composition, “Deutsche Fest-und Gedenksprüche,”
a double concerto for violin and violoncello, Gipsy
songs and many other vocal and chamber works
complete the list of his more
recent compositions. And
more great things may be
expected from him. If there
is anything inspiring in the
present aspect of musical art,
it is the fact that Johannes
Brahms is still among us, physically
and mentally as strong as
if perpetual youth were granted
to him. Indeed, the graces
and heroes have not only kept
watch at his cradle, but guided
him throughout his long
career.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Those who have met him
will never forget the impression
of his strong personality.
Nor will those who saw him
conduct or heard him play
ever enter into the superfluous
discussion whether he was a
great leader of orchestra and
chorus or a master of his instrument. For in both
directions he was not only equal to the most exacting
demands, but always appeared as if inspired, and
inspiring everybody who sang or played under him
or listened to the genius of his music. At the pianoforte
and the conductor’s desk he is a king, but
socially he appears unaffected and easy, neither reticent
nor predominating in conversation, jolly and
kind among friends and children. He has never married.
Many honors have been conferred upon him:
the degrees of Doctor of Music by the University of
Cambridge, England, in 1877, and of Doctor of
Philosophy by the Breslau University in 1879; also
several orders and the membership of many societies
and institutes. Throughout the musical world
his music, especially his instrumental works, is now
received with enthusiasm, although still finding a
strong opposition on the part of many critics of
either too conservative or too progressive tendencies.
Yet the time is not far distant when it will
be generally granted a high position in the history
of our art.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Three prominent characteristics of Brahms’ works
command our admiration. From the start he appeared
as a strong individuality, and notwithstanding
a leaning towards Bach’s polyphonic art and
harmonic wealth, Beethoven’s virile pathos and
ideality of purpose, and Schubert’s melodic charm,
he has spoken his own distinct language. In every
field of composition except the opera he has contributed
masterpieces which show that in each he has
to-day no superior, and in but few an equal.
Throughout he impresses us by the fact that to him
art has always been something sacred, worthy of
highest effort and noblest purpose. In this respect
one may well compare him to Bach or Beethoven
or Schiller, of whom Goethe so beautifully said,
that “far behind him lay that which conquers us
all,—vulgarity.” Whoever honestly strives for the
sympathy of his genius must be filled with a like
earnest spirit, willing to be guided by his subtle art
into ideal regions full of higher joys than common
musical amusements afford.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wealth of his melodic, rhythmic and harmonic
invention is truly astonishing; his combinations are
so new and often intricate, the thematic material so
rich or peculiar, its development so elaborate, that
it is a commonly expressed opinion that his music
has to do more with the intellect than with imagination
and feeling. The truth is, that no modern
composer has expressed deeper and more fervent
feelings, either jubilant or sad, than Brahms. His
great intellect only guides the wealth of emotion
in order to find a well balanced, wholly original and
artistic construction for the creatures of his rich
imagination. And he is an eminently modern composer;
with all his so-called conservative tendencies
there is hardly a page in his works which could
have been written at an earlier stage of musical art.
Familiar with all the subtleties of modern expression
and innovations of harmony, rhythm, and instrumentation,
he has himself introduced many new and
bold features.</p>

<p class='c007'>To speak in detail of the one hundred and fifteen
published works of Brahms would require a space
far beyond the limits of this sketch. Thus only a
summary classification is possible. Looking first
at the instrumental compositions, one cannot praise
Brahms too highly, that in opposition to prevailing
tendencies towards a neglect of cyclic forms in
favor of free, rhapsodic or programmatic fantasias,
he has cultivated the former with supreme devotion,
enriching and modifying them in many ways, but
so that they still appear as worthy representatives
of their types.</p>

<p class='c007'>The three pianoforte sonatas and the Scherzo Op.
4 reveal the cardinal features of his later chamber
and orchestral works: a most excellent thematic
material, consisting often of but a few notes, awakening
highest expectations; a rich, ingenious development,
always coherent and logical; a Beethovenish
virility; distinct contrasts and wonderful climaxes in
the lively opening and closing movements, usually
beginning directly with the principal subject, the
working-out section being especially interesting and
elaborate, the coda often of rare charm; the slow
movements of delicate or intense, always noble feeling,
in the form of variations or a long cantilena;
the scherzos on a large plan, in three-four or six-eight
time, very spirited, with a quieter trio preceding
the finale, except in No. 3, where a short
intermezzo is interpolated. Everywhere we note
an ample and effective use of syncopations, a
peculiar style of accompaniments, bold modulations
and rhythmic devices, occasionally even some programmatic
suggestions. Few masters have shown
such originality and maturity in their first works.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of independent pianoforte variations there are
sixteen on a touching theme of Schumann, eleven
on a beautiful original theme, thirteen on a Hungarian
theme (with a combination of three-four
and four-four time), twenty-five splendid variations
on a short theme of Handel ending with a
great fugue, some very difficult variations on a theme
of Paganini, and—in a more romantic spirit—nine
for four hands on that peculiar theme which Schumann
had received “from the spirits of Schubert
and Mendelssohn.” Some of these important
works have a suggestive and refined sentimental
character, others are virtuoso pieces of the highest
order. As regards free conception of the variation
form and variety of construction and mood, Brahms
goes decidedly farther than Beethoven or Schumann.
He seems inexhaustible in this form, which he used
later most ingeniously also in chamber and orchestra
works. The four poetic ballads Op. 10,
the capriccios and intermezzos Op. 76 and two
Rhapsodies Op. 79 are fine concert pieces of a freer
but always coherent style, often very difficult. More
popular are the famous Hungarian dances (fascinating
settings of melodies, the authorship of which
Brahms has never claimed), which he has orchestrated
and arranged for four hands. His waltzes
Op. 39, also for four hands, are short character-pieces
of a bright, graceful or passionate spirit, in
certain features recalling Schubert and Schumann,
yet so original that they have been much imitated
by younger composers. Several piano works for
technical study (after Weber, Chopin and Bach),
and fine arrangements of most of his chamber
works and orchestra serenades and of a gavotte of
Gluck may at least be mentioned. The difficulties
of his pianoforte style, so rich in polyphonic figuration,
harmonic and rhythmic combinations, syncopations,
and wide stretches, especially abound in
the two seldom-played concertos. Yet, without the
highest appreciation and sympathetic devotion, the
greatest virtuosity would never be able to make their
inner life clear.</p>

<p class='c007'>Like a giant appears the early written D minor
concerto. Quick modulations, syncopations, chains
of trills and a Beethovenish importance of themes
and development impress us mightily in the passionate
first movement, divine sweetness in the long
adagio, while the finale, with its fantasia-like cadenza,
rises from a simple mood to the acme of enthusiasm.
The B flat concerto Op. 83 has even four
movements, the long and romantic opening allegro
being followed by an allegro appassionato of a
superior scherzo character, the delightful andante
by a highly effective allegro grazioso as finale. In
spite of the elaborate development and the variety
of contrasting moods, the whole work retains a
bright and inspiring character. In both concertos
the important and richly scored symphonic accompaniment
only raises the solo part to greater prominence.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fugue and a choral prelude with fugue are
Brahms’ only but significant compositions for the
organ.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chamber works secure our master a place
of honor beside the greatest representatives of this
high branch of composition; they comprise three
sonatas for violin and two for violoncello and pianoforte,
five pianoforte trios (one with horn and one
with clarinet), three string quartets, three pianoforte
quartets, three string quintets (one with clarinet), one
pianoforte quintet and two string sextets. In the
older works one feels often the struggle of a great
soul with strong passions, longings, hopes and anxieties,
joys and pains, yet not lacking in sunshine and
humor, while in the more recent compositions a
quieter, more contemplative spirit prevails. The
classic arrangement of four movements forms the
rule, most of them being very elaborate and extensive,
rich in themes of importance and beauty, the
working out and coda showing Brahms’ genius in
the finest light, the treatment of the different instruments
being throughout masterly. The complicated
development often prevents an immediate enjoyment,
but increases our desire for a closer acquaintance;
for this counterpoint goes always hand in
hand with true feeling. In the opening movements
the first part is not always repeated, and other
novel features are introduced; the slow movements in
the form of variations or of a long developed cantilena
often lift us into high and unwonted regions;
the scherzos are so full of genius that one wonders
why Brahms has not used this form in his symphonies.
The finales are of the highest order, seldom
reached by other modern composers. In the works
with horn and clarinets these much neglected instruments
have received a wonderful treatment in music
of great beauty. Unusual and complicated rhythms
appear frequently, but treated in a surprisingly easy
way. The details are throughout deeply interesting,
yet often strange, even the most peaceful movements
requiring closest attention. If one of all these
great works must be distinguished as the greatest,
we would name the pianoforte quintet in F minor,
Op. 34. Yet the very latest work, the clarinet
quintet, shows the same freshness and originality of
invention, wonderful thematic net-work, variety of
distinctly expressed moods, and the finale displaying
an unsurpassed skill in variations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two orchestra serenades are real gems of
spirited, delightful, well constructed music, one
being for complete orchestra, the other for violas,
’celli, basses, reed instruments and horns. Besides
the lively first and last movements and adagios they
contain each a scherzo and one of them two
minuets.</p>

<p class='c007'>The theme for the nine orchestra variations Op.
56 is taken from one of Haydn’s divertimenti for
wind instruments. They crown Brahms’ glorious
achievements in the writing of variations; for, far
from being “mere algebraic experiments,” they are
delightful and ingenious tone pictures of distinct
character and mood, with a nearer or more remote
relation to the principal theme. The composer has
thus initiated a new field of independent orchestral
music, already successfully followed by others.
The instrumentation is prominently interesting. It
is generally admitted that Brahms is very conservative
compared with Wagner and Berlioz in the
matter of instrumentation. At least he never allows
orchestral colors to divert our attention from the
higher, inner meaning of a work. Yet in this score
and in all his other works for or with orchestra,
there are many features either of wonderful brilliancy
or peculiar colors, which as novelties are worth studying.
The finale, built upon a much repeated bass
figure, successively joined by the different groups
of the orchestra with
other themes, reaches
a beautiful climax in
the pompous return of
the original melody.</p>

<p>JOHANNES BRAHMS.<br>  <br>  From an engraving by Weger, after a photograph from life.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The four symphonies
in C minor, D, F and
E minor are justly regarded
as the most
important orchestral
works of our generation.
Much is still
written against them,
and not everybody is
willing or able to share
the enthusiasm which
their good performance
arouses among
the majority of cultivated
audiences. Yet
nothing can shake
their high position
among all symphonic
works written since the
great master of the
immortal Ninth has
left this earth. They have each a very individual
character and, although in the main the old form is
retained, new features are to be found in almost
every movement. The first symphony opens with
an impressive sostenuto introduction, the others
begin at once with the principal subject of the
allegro. Usually the first part of the latter is
brought to a formal close and repeated; only in
the fourth symphony, so rich in thematic material,
no repetition occurs, but a very elaborate working
out prepares for the climax reached in the concentrated
recapitulation. Everywhere noble themes are
finely contrasted, wonderfully developed, wholly or
in fragments, in the working out, so as to hold the
listener in breathless suspense. The allegros of the
first and second symphonies have particularly fine
codas. The slow movements are not very extensive
and are easily enjoyed, their quieter and lofty mood
being but little disturbed. However, the adagio
in No. 2 is more complicated, has richer material,
more frequent changes of key and rhythm, a more
elaborate figure work and a peculiarly intimate
spirit. A remarkable innovation is the consequent
substitution for a minuet or scherzo of a sort
of intermezzo, full of
grace, sunshine and
innocent playfulness,
hardly disturbed by
more serious episodes.
Most extended is this
in No. 4, a rondo with
themes of an almost
grotesque character,
surprising details in
their development and
a spirit of true Beethoven-like
humor. Yet
those of the first three
symphonies are of no
less importance, having
two distinct parts, of
which the second one
(contrary to the older
trio) has a livelier character.
Especially that
of No. 2 is one of the
most delightful orchestral
pieces of modern
literature. That
Brahms is indeed a
symphonist of the highest rank, is particularly
evident in his finales. That of No. 1 is conceived
in the grandest spirit, opened by a solemn introduction
of overwhelming beauty and impressiveness,
the allegro based on themes of rare inspiration,
their wonderful development rising from climax
to climax like a great triumphal procession. Still
the finale of No. 2 is not less inspiring; even more
brilliant, with its glorious themes, the splendid instrumentation
and exciting coda. In No. 3 the
closing movement has the unusual minor key, is less
dithyrambic, yet not lacking in life, a choral-like
episode forming a fine contrast, and the whole ending
happily in a long, quiet coda in F major with a
poetic reminiscence of the principal subject of the
opening movement. One may justly regard the
finale of No. 4 as a musical wonder, a new experiment
gloriously carried out. It has the shape of
a passacaglia, an old dance constructed upon a
ground bass. The theme consists of eight bars,
each represented by a chord, and is treated in about
thirty variations of the most ingenious contrapuntal
devices, greatly contrasted, yet so coherently that it
sounds like an uninterrupted logical development,
holding our interest keenly alive and increasing our
enjoyment till the splendid end is reached.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have thus seen how many strong features
Brahms has introduced in the symphonic form,
without departing from its classic foundation; but it
is still more important that as a genius of a superior
mind and noble soul he had the right material in
himself to fill this greatest form of instrumental
music with an adequate and original inner life, reflecting
the highest spirit of modern German civilization.</p>

<p class='c007'>The characteristic feature of the Academic Festival
Overture is the successive introduction of several
German student melodies, not in the form of a potpourri,
as it has been unjustly regarded, but as themes
developed with consummate art, expressing the inspiration
of a solemn festival, of loyalty to the fatherland,
of merrymaking and youthful exultation. Every
page shows the hand of a superior master. Still
greater is the tragic overture, its spirit reflecting a
heroic struggle, gloom, solemnity, but also hope and
comfort; its form being particularly interesting by
an ingenious combination of the working out and
recapitulation into a sort of free, yet coherent, wonderfully
constructed and deeply impressive fantasia.</p>

<p class='c007'>How much we should like to speak in detail of the
two concertos for violin and for violin and ’cello! It
would be a misnomer to call them symphonies with
obligato solo parts, notwithstanding the very elaborate
orchestral score, but more incorrect to compare
them with any virtuoso concertos. Enormous technical
difficulties are to be conquered in the service
of high musical purposes. The arrangement is after
the classic model, in three movements. Of these the
slow movements with their melodic breadth are the
more enjoyable, while the extensive outer movements,
with their rich development of peculiarly fine
and original themes, require repeated hearings to
reveal all their innate beauty and greatness. And
these works, too, belong to the future and can afford
to await their time for a general appreciation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brahms’ earlier chorus works are an Ave Maria
for female chorus and orchestra, a funeral chant
with wind instruments, four female choruses with harp
and two horns, seven Marianan songs, a setting of
the 23d Psalm for female chorus and organ, several
motets and part songs for four, five or six voices,
sacred songs, and twelve romances for female chorus,
partly with piano accompaniment. Now and then
we are reminded of the style of Palestrina or old
German folk-songs, then again of Bach’s polyphonic
art with fugues, simple and double canons, yet
throughout of a new, peculiar mode of expression,
full of poetic sentiment. Among the works of later
years we mention two motets, which are praised as
Brahms’ highest achievements in polyphonic writing,
seven songs for mixed voices, and many arrangements
of old German folk-songs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The German Requiem is of such great importance,
that without a knowledge of it neither a full estimation
of Brahms’ individual genius nor of the significance
of the latest epoch of music in general can
be obtained. Taking from the old Latin funeral
mass only the name, Brahms selected certain verses
from the Bible, expressing not only the sadness and
terror of death and judgment, but also hope and
consolation,—even thankfulness and praise. His
work, independent of any church service and to
be sung in a living language, contains in each note
music which came from the depth of a noble soul
and was written by a master of the highest and most
complicated field of vocal composition. Entirely
free from conventionalities or dry learning, each of
the seven numbers gives completely what his genius
was able to accomplish. It is indeed the great
funeral chant of modern music, at least for Germans
and Protestants. Choruses I., IV., V. and VII.
have a quiet character, finely expressing the milder
feelings above mentioned, yet with all their seeming
simplicity showing a consummate art in the details
of their construction, No. V. being mainly given to a
difficult soprano solo. No. II. (“Behold all flesh is
as the grass”) is a peculiar funeral march in three-four
time, the chorus singing partly in unison to
strange and impressive orchestral music; after a
touching animato (“Be patient unto the coming of
Christ”) the principal melody is repeated, followed
by a long fugue (“The redeemed of the Lord shall
return again”). No. III. opens with a baritone
solo, lamenting the frailty of life, soon joined by the
chorus, rising to a climax expressive of hope. Then
follows that famous fugue, in an astonishingly
rich polyphonic treatment, moving over an uninterrupted,
much criticised pedal point on D to
emphasize the words, that “the righteous souls are
in the hand of God.” No. VI. is regarded as the
culmination of the work. After the chorus’ lament
that “Here on earth we have no continuing place,”
comfort is brought by the baritone voice unfolding
the mystery of the resurrection. The chorus repeat
this and burst out in an ecstatic vivace, “The trumpet
shall sound, the dead shall be raised!...”
“... Grave, where is thy victory, death, where is
thy sting?” In wonderful modulations climax after
climax is reached; finally in glorious C major a
double fugue is added, a hymn of praise to “the
Lord of honor and might,” whose proportion, art and
impressiveness alone suffice to make Brahms a compeer
of the greatest masters of polyphonic music.
Throughout, chorus, orchestra and soloists have to
overcome the greatest difficulties, but seldom are
their efforts directed to more ideal purposes.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>JOHANNES BRAHMS.<br>  <br>  From a photograph from life by Fr. Luckhardt, Vienna.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>For the “Song of Triumph” Brahms selected
some mysterious verses from the Apocalypse.
Of the three large numbers for double chorus, orchestra
and organ, some portions have been called
direct imitations of Handel; yet even there one
finds enough of Brahms’ individuality and throughout
an intense heartiness and directness of feeling.
In singing this music, one is overwhelmed by its
grandeur. The second number, more purely
Brahms’, is of particular beauty, the chorus “Let us
rejoice” being joined by a cantus firmus of the
wood instruments on the choral “Now, thank ye all
the Lord!” In No. III., opened by a baritone
solo, an enthusiasm is reached in the Hallelujah
surpassing any jubilant chorus music written since
the Ninth Symphony.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Deutsche Fest-und Gedenksprüche” have
a uniform patriotic purpose. There are again three
large and most difficult numbers for double chorus,
without solo or accompaniment. No. I. refers to the
battle of Leipsic in 1813 and the regained liberty
from the Napoleonic bondage (“Our fathers hoped
in thee, thou helpedst them,” etc.), and has an imposing
character of resolution and vigor. No. II.,
referring to the collapse of the French in 1870,
illustrates in lively contrasting colors “a palace
guarded by one strongly armed and remaining in
peace” and “an empire that falls in discord and
becomes waste.” No. III. praises the splendor of
the new united empire, but warns its people “to
beware and guard thy soul well, that it shall never
forget the story which thine eyes have seen.” A
deeply religious spirit also pervades this great and
but little known work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Rhapsody for alto solo, male chorus and
orchestra treats a portion of Goethe’s “Journey
through the Hartz in Winter.” Once in 1777 the
poet left a hunting party to pay an incognito visit
to a young admirer of his genius, who was in a
Wertherish despondent condition of mind. The
impression received by this adventure gave rise to
one of his deepest yet somewhat mysterious poems,
which inspired Brahms to one of his greatest works.
The opening orchestral sounds touch our inmost
heart; sighs and the anguish of a trembling soul is
their spirit; then the solo voice in tones of intense
feeling asks for comfort for one “who from the fullness
of love drank hate of man and in loneliness
devours all that hath worth in him.” A peculiar
combination of three-two and six-four time illustrates
finely this anguish and restlessness. Gradually
the music becomes more quiet, till with a harp-like
accompaniment, chorus and soloist sing a hymn
of indescribable beauty and loftiness, imploring “the
all-loving Father to enlighten the heart of the unfortunate,
if but one tone from his psalter can reach
His ears.” The solo part requires a truly inspired
musician, whose voice is the instrument of his soul.
The short chorus is also a difficult task. Many
times has the writer heard this heavenly work, but
never without its repetition being demanded and
given. Yet how little known it is in this country!</p>

<p class='c007'>An extensive work for male chorus with tenor solo
and orchestra is the cantata “Rinaldo,” the text
being again from Goethe. It deals with a romantic
story from Tasso’s “Jerusalem Delivered,” has partly
a solemn, partly a lively dramatic character and
breathes the refreshing air of the sea. The more
or less extensive and elaborate choruses are very
different from the conventional style, the solo part is
unusually difficult and so exacting that an adequate
performance is seldom secured.</p>

<p class='c007'>In three works Brahms has illustrated the relentlessness
of Fate, selecting poems of almost Greek
grandeur and beauty. Hölderlin’s “Song of Destiny”
contrasts the blessed abode of the divine
spirits with the fate of the “restless, grief-laden
mortals, who blindly wander from one sad hour to
another.” Schiller’s “Nänie” mourns “that even
the Beautiful fades and the Highest must die,” and
“The Song of the Fates,” from Goethe’s “Iphigenia,”
warns the human race “to fear the gods, doubly
those whom they have exalted, for they turn from
entire races the light of their eyes.” The last work
is for six, the others for four chorus voices. Everywhere
the orchestra is important, rich in weird, characteristic
effects. Bold modulations and rhythmic
combinations always in keeping with the composer’s
high conception of the poetry affect deeply ear and
heart. Who but Brahms could have found music
so worthy of such profound poetical subjects! In
the “Song of Destiny” he even surpasses the poet
by repeating at the end the wonderful orchestral
introduction indicating hope for our own final attainment
of the abode of the blessed spirits. The
“Nänie” is dedicated to the mother of the lamented
painter Feuerbach, who had been a true art companion
of Brahms. Only a careful, sympathetic rendering
will reveal the beauty of this work. In the
“Song of the Fates” there is a movement of a quiet,
melodious character, which many critics have declared
to be entirely contrary to the meaning of the
text. To us it seems more like a well justified,
touching expression of pious submission, wonderfully
calming our excitement for the mysterious ending
with its harmonies and orchestral sounds never
heard before.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brighter is the character of some works belonging
to a field which Schumann had specially cultivated,
yet where Brahms shows again such originality
that he has been much imitated. His delightful
vocal quartets with piano accompaniment, graceful
and bright or deep and gloomy, charm greatly by
their artistic construction, beauty of thought, feeling
and sound and peculiarity of colors. Still more famous
are the two collections of Love-Song Waltzes
for voices and piano for four hands, resembling the
sparkling pianoforte waltzes Op. 39, most varying
in shape and mood, the words being mainly from
Daumer’s “Polydora,” those of the fine, quiet closing
movement in nine-four time being selected from
Goethe. The eleven Gipsy Songs Op. 102 are also
meeting with an enthusiastic reception, Hungarian
spirit and rhythm giving them a peculiar color, the
moods being either humorous or passionate, melancholy
or exuberant, quartets alternating with solos, the
accompaniment being as elaborate as it is effective.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the twenty highly remarkable duets some
have, in spite of many harmonic and rhythmic
finesses, quite a plain character, while others are
very elaborate, the voices either joining or alternating.
As particularly typical we mention “The
Seas,” “The Nun and the Knight,” “The Sisters,”
“The Messengers of Love,” “Edward,” and “Let us
wander.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally we have reached the field in which
Brahms has been especially fertile and original, his
“Lieder.” To speak of them only in a general
way is difficult indeed. Thirty-one of the published
115 works contain nearly 200 songs. Throughout his
whole career Brahms has been writing songs; there
was in his soul a lyric element, kindled again and
again by the beauty of feeling, thought and diction of
the great German poets, and he found a style of song-writing
so independent, that in spite of some more
or less striking exceptions one can hardly trace his
relation to Schubert, Schumann and Franz. He is
their equal as regards wealth of invention, noble conception
of the text, finishing of details. Yet in treatment
of the voice, relation between vocal and instrumental
part, and construction of the latter he opens
a new path. In the selection of poems he shows
eminent knowledge and taste. Many half-forgotten
poems of a superior order he has awakened to fresh
life; others, which on account of their peculiar
metre or meaning have been avoided, have found
in him an unexpectedly effective interpreter. However,
it seems to us as if the poems often suffer
transformation. They have inspired the composer
with certain tone-pictures, which in turn impose upon
them very distinctly the spirit of his own strong individuality.
This individuality is by no means always
deep and heavy, for smiles and dancing are no
strangers to it. Often the melodies are as plain as
folk-songs, but always of great nobility. With a few
notes the composer reaches our hearts and lifts us
at once into a higher region. Other melodies again
are as elaborate as a dramatic scene. The accompaniment,
inexhaustible in forms, yet never conventional,
simple or with great harmonic wealth and
peculiar figuration, rivals the singer in expressing
the moods of the poem. Of the so-called folk-songs
(old German, Swiss, Bohemian, Scotch,
Italian, etc.) some are treated most artistically,
others with a touching simplicity. Very few poems
composed by other masters are found among his
list, and the favorite poets Heine, Eichendorff, Chamisso
are almost avoided. A remarkable exception
is the separately published “Moon-night,” very different
from Schumann’s jewel song, yet not inferior.
Goethe, Hölty, Platen, Tieck, Schenkendorf, Groth
and Möricke are fully represented, often by poems
of an antique spirit and form. Keller, Daumer,
Heyse, Schack, Herder and many others inspired
Brahms too, and it is noteworthy that he had no
music for meaningless trivialities. The majority of
these songs are devoted to love in all possible phases
and moods, often wonderfully reflected in scenes of
nature. There is perhaps more of twilight and autumn
than of sunshine and spring, but exultant and
happy moods are well represented,—also flowers,
birds, woods, oceans and storms and the stillness of
the fields,—but all these more in a symbolic than
realistic conception and with a wonderful coloring of
the prevailing mood. The sweet little “Cradle
song,” “Erinnerung,” “Minnelied,” “Wie bist du,
meine Königin?” “Meine Liebe ist grün,” “Von
ewiger Liebe,” “Ruhe, Süssliebchen,” “Mainacht,”
“Vergebliches Ständchen” are only a few familiar
jewels among the rich collection; how many more
deserve the same sympathy and study from singers
with noble artistic ambitions! Special mention is
due to the two fine songs for alto with viola obligato
Op. 91 and to the fifteen romances from Tieck’s
half-forgotten fairy tale “Die schöne Magelone,”
which have a most elaborate form and an intensely
emotional character. Nowhere indeed can one get a
better estimate of Brahms’ high significance as a
song writer than here, where the poet appears like
a dwarf in the light of the composer’s higher genius.</p>

<p class='c007'>Greatness indeed remains Brahms’ characteristic
feature, wherever we look at him or at his works;
greatness in ideas, purposes and powers; greatness
in self-criticism and faithfulness to the dignity of his
art; greatness in the devotion to past masters and
independence of contemporary influences; greatness
in the sincerity and simplicity of his manners
and relation to the outer world. Never appearing as
a revolutionary spirit, yet he has himself introduced
many strong innovations in various fields, and for a
long time his works will not only afford profound
enjoyment to earnest lovers of our art, but be a
source of the most valuable studies for those to
whom its further development will be entrusted.
Long has he been ignored, patiently has he waited,
till the world has come to him to respect in him the
noblest musical genius of our time.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
The date of the birth of Carl Goldmark,
the eminent Austrian composer,
is incorrectly given in the
various biographical dictionaries to
which the writer has had access.
For correct information on this point and for the
facts contained in the following sketch of the musician’s
life, thanks are due to Leopold Goldmark, his
brother. Carl Goldmark was born at Keszthely,
Hungary, May 18, 1830. He came by his musical
inclinations naturally, for his father, Ruben Goldmark,
was a precentor, much esteemed on account
of his fine voice. The son showed a fondness for
music at an early age and when very young began
to take lessons on the violin at the Musikverein of
Oedenburg. His progress was such that at the age
of twelve his father permitted him to play in public.
Soon afterward he began to play professionally in
theatre orchestras. He continued to do so until the
revolution of 1848, when he was obliged to go into
service in the army under the <i><span lang="de">landsturm</span></i> law.</p>

<p class='c007'>When his term of service had come to an end he
went to Vienna, where, with the assistance of his
eldest brother, Dr. Joseph Goldmark, he resumed
his studies, becoming a pupil in the Böhm Conservatorium.
Unfortunately for the young man, Dr.
Goldmark had been an active participant in the insurrection
and was suspected of implication in the
killing of Minister of War, La Tour. He was compelled
to leave Austria and came to America, where
he died in 1863. His flight threw Carl on his own
resources, and the young musician succeeded in
obtaining an engagement in the theatre orchestra at
Raab, Hungary. Toward the end of 1850, however,
he returned to Vienna, where he secured employment
in the orchestra of the Theatre in the Josefstadt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Young Goldmark at this time showed very plainly
of what sort of material he was made. His salary
amounted to about $8 a month, but his ambition was
worth hundreds. He was consumed by a desire to
learn to play the piano, but he could not afford to
pay a teacher. He managed, however, to hire an
instrument, and began to study by himself with occasional
hints from friends. Returning late from
the theatre to his humble lodgings, he would spend
half the night in practising by the light of a tallow
candle. It may as well be said here that he became
sufficiently proficient as a pianist to give lessons in
later years, and he also taught himself the art of
singing with such success that he became the instructor
of Mme. Bettelheim, a contralto who attained
prominence on the Austrian stage. With
the exception of his violin lessons and a short
course in composition at the Vienna Conservatory
under Sechter, self-instruction was all the teaching
enjoyed by young Goldmark. He studied assiduously
the scores of Mozart, Weber and Beethoven,
and attended the Helmesberger chamber music
concerts in Vienna, thus gaining a valuable acquaintance
with the instrumental works of the best masters.
Goldmark was, however, not only a student of
music. He made himself conversant with the
German, French, Italian and English Languages.
He also became a devoted student of philosophy,
and learned to look up to Schopenhauer with a truly
Wagnerian admiration. In 1850 he became a contributor
to the <cite>Grenzboten</cite> and to some of the Leipsic
musical papers. His writings have always shown
evidence of his wide culture.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was in 1855 that he began to compose, and in
1857 he gave a concert of his own works at the
Vienna Musikverein-Halle. The compositions presented
were an overture, a piano quartet, a ballad
for tenor, chorus and orchestra, and two songs. He
was at that period of his career a devoted follower of
Mendelssohn, and the works played at his concert
were in that master’s style. Goldmark’s fondness
for his early offspring was short-lived and the works
were not published. He outlived his Mendelssohnian
devotion and subsequently became a fervent
admirer of Schumann, whose influence is clearly discernible
in some of his later works.</p>

<p class='c007'>The composer’s first decided success was the
overture to “Sakuntala,” opus 13, written in 1864,
and now known favorably all over Europe and in
this country. In 1865, while walking in one of the
principal streets of Vienna, he saw a picture of the
Queen of Sheba visiting Solomon. The picture
made a vivid impression on his imagination, and at
length he went to H. S. Mosenthal, the well known
dramatist, author of “Leah, the Forsaken,” and
begged him to undertake the task of constructing a
libretto out of the story which had grown up in the
composer’s mind. In three years the opera was
finished in its first shape, but Goldmark was dissatisfied
with it. Mosenthal made the desired changes
in the book, and about one-half of the score was rewritten,
the work being finished early in 1872.
Goldmark then submitted it to Joseph Herbeck,
conductor of the court opera at Vienna. It is believed
that Herbeck was jealous of Goldmark,
because the latter had defeated him in a competition
for a Government prize of 800 gulden. At any rate
Herbeck kept the score of “The Queen of Sheba”
locked up for two years. Finally, at a musicale given
by the Princess Hohenlohe, whose husband was
master of ceremonies to the Emperor, Ignatz Brüll,
then a rising young pianist, played some selections
from Goldmark’s opera. The Princess and others,
pleased by the music, asked Brüll some questions
about the work, and the story of Herbeck’s delay
over the score came out. The influence of the
Princess and the Countess Andrassy led to an imperial
command for the production of the opera, and
it was accordingly performed on March 10, 1875.
The success of the opera was great and the composer
was called out nearly forty times. “The Queen of
Sheba” has been given in various European cities,
and was first performed in America at the Metropolitan
Opera House, New York, on Wednesday,
Dec. 2, 1885, with the following cast: Sulamith,
Frau Lilli Lehman; the Queen, Frau Krämer-Wiedl;
Astaroth, Fräulein Marianne Brandt; Solomon,
Herr Robinson; Assad, Herr Stritt; Baal
Hanan, Herr Alexi; High Priest, Herr Fischer.
The conductor was Anton Seidl. It was the most
successful opera in the repertory of the house that
season, being presented fifteen times, to aggregate
receipts of $60,000. It was given four times the
following season, and again five times in the season
of 1889–90, always to audiences of good size.</p>

<p class='c007'>His second opera, “Merlin,” was produced in
Vienna Nov. 19, 1886, and at the Metropolitan
Opera House Jan. 3, 1887, with the following cast:
Viviane, Lilli Lehmann; Morgana, Brandt; Artus,
Robinson; Modred, Kemlitz; Gawein, Heinrich;
Lancelot, Basch; Merlin, Alvary; Dämon, Fischer.
The conductor was Walter Damrosch. It was performed
five times in the course of the season, but
did not achieve the success of its predecessor. While
waiting for the production of “The Queen of
Sheba,” Goldmark wrote his B flat quartet and his
suite for piano and violin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Goldmark has devoted his life to composition.
He takes no pupils and has refused not only all
orders and distinctions, but all offers of posts as conductor.
The only office he has ever held—and
that but briefly—is the presidency of the Vienna
Tonkünstlerverein. His home is in Vienna, but
about May 1st of every year he goes to Gmunden,
on the Traunsee in upper Austria. There he remains
till October, working incessantly except during four
weeks in midsummer. He then takes a vacation,
going to the Fusch valley, near Salzburg, where he
spends six to eight hours a day in mountain climbing.
All his composing is done at Gmunden. He is
a widower and has a daughter twenty years of age.</p>

<p class='c007'>Goldmark’s principal works are the two operas
already mentioned, the “Sakuntala,” “Penthesilea,”
“Spring” and “Prometheus” overtures, the symphony
in E flat and the “Ländliche Hochzeit”
symphony, and the violin concerto in A minor, opus
28. These are the works by which he is best known
in this country, his chamber music being played infrequently.
The composer’s musical development
is readily divided into two periods. He made the
division himself when, in 1875, he decided that he
would abandon his earlier style of writing, in which
he had made extensive use of Oriental melody and
color. He imbibed a fondness for this style when
in his childhood he listened to the voice of his
father in the synagogue. He himself seems to have
felt, however, that in giving his music a local or
racial coloring he was detracting from its universality,
and after the production of the “Queen of Sheba,”
he said to his friends that he would write no more
eastern music. It was doubtless this determination
which led him to select the story of Merlin as the
subject for his next opera. The most thoughtful
critics of Goldmark’s music are of the opinion that
he was not wise in his determination. As an Oriental
colorist in music, he certainly has no superior,
and probably no equal, while his “Merlin” is without
the most interesting manifestations of his individuality.
Goldmark without his color is Swinburne
without his versification. The composer’s best
works, except the overture to “Prometheus,” are
surely those written before the resolution of 1875.</p>

<p class='c007'>The story of “The Queen of Sheba” is not taken
from the Bible, but is purely imaginary. It deals
with the fascination of Assad, a courtier, by the
beautiful Queen, who has indulged in a passage of
love with him on her journey to Solomon’s court.
When Assad recognizes her in Solomon’s palace, she
denies having met him before, but both Solomon and
Sulamith, Assad’s promised bride, see that something
is wrong. The Queen again shows herself to
Assad by night, and the next day in the palace.
Assad proclaims the truth. Solomon decrees that
the youth must work out his salvation by defeating
the powers of evil, and banishes him to the desert.
Sulamith seeks him and he dies in her arms, while
the Queen and her caravan are seen in the distance
returning homeward. Dr. Mosenthal’s libretto is not
a fine poetic achievement, but it is theatrically very
effective, blending spectacular and dramatic scenes
in a telling manner. The composer has made excellent
use of his opportunities. Assad’s recital of his
first adventure with the Queen, is set to admirably
descriptive music, and it is followed by a most captivating
ballet and an inspiring chorus of greeting
to the Queen. The ensuing scene is richly dramatic.
The duet between the Queen and Assad
in the moonlit garden is intensely passionate and
glows with the warm color of eastern melody. The
instrumental richness of the score seems to be quite
as natural an outcome of the composer’s fancy as
his easy adoption of Oriental rhythms and cadences,
which he handled as one to the manner born. The
most important objection which has been made to
this music is that it is “so unvaryingly stimulated that
it wearies and makes the listener long for a fresher
and healthier musical atmosphere.” The production
of “The Queen of Sheba” in New York was
one of the most brilliant spectacles ever seen in
America, and the performances were rich in musical
merit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The comparative failure of “Merlin” was due
largely to the effort of the librettist, Herr Siegfried
Lipiner, to mingle the supernatural with the story of
Merlin and Vivien and to drag in Goethe’s principle
of saving womanhood—a favorite theme with
Wagner. Indeed, there are many things in the libretto
which indicate that it was suggested by Wagnerian
works, chiefly “Parsifal.” The librettist’s
greatest success was in his characterization of Vivien,
which is excellent. The composer also fell into the
Wagnerian pit and strove vainly to handle the <cite>Leitmotif</cite>.
His music, moreover, suffered, as has already
been intimated, from his determined effort to
rid himself of the Oriental color which was his
natural garb. Nevertheless it must be said in justice
to Goldmark, that no operatic writer of our time has
shown a greater seriousness of purpose than that
manifested in “Merlin.” The musical dialogue of
the opera is nobly elevated in style, but lacks variety.
The orchestration is rich and glowing in
color, yet is without complexity of construction, and
there is a delightful absence of the set forms of the
old-fashioned opera. But “Merlin” lacks the inspiration
and the spontaneity of style which are displayed
by the composer when laboring in his congenial
Oriental field.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Ländliche Hochzeit” symphony is a symphony
in name rather than in fact. It is a series of
descriptive movements, written with a little of the
composer’s characteristic tinge of Orientalism and
with all of his mastery of instrumental coloring. It
is fluent, melodious and strongly rhythmical. In
short, it is music that pleases a miscellaneous audience
without offending the discriminating music-lover.
The symphony in E flat, like the violin
concerto, the present writer regards as one of the
composer’s least happy achievements. It is but
just to say, however, that some good judges do not
hold this opinion of the work. The first movement is
built on a flowing and rhythmic theme announced by
the violins, and from this the second subject is very
happily deduced; but neither is fruitful in itself.
The scherzo is by far the best movement, and is, indeed,
a bit of writing of which any recent symphonist
might be proud. It is light and airy in theme and
the instrumentation is effective.</p>

<p class='c007'>The violin concerto in A minor is lacking in
spontaneity of thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we turn to Goldmark’s overtures, however,
we find the composer at his best. All his overtures
are admirable, one is exceptionally fine, and another
is great. The “Sakuntala” overture is deemed
Goldmark’s best by many critics, but the present
writer prefers the “Prometheus.” The story of the
love of King Dushyanta for Sakuntala, daughter of
the Saint Viswamitra and the water nymph Menaka,
is one of the most beautiful in the Hindoo mythology.
The maiden is reared in the forest by Kanwa,
and there Dushyanta, while hunting, meets and
loves her. The principal themes in Goldmark’s
overture are the melodies representing Sakuntala’s
loneliness in the forest, the royal hunt, and the love
of the king and the maiden. The composition is
opulent in its Oriental richness of color and is full of
the passionate intensity and vigorous aggressiveness
of the strongest scenes in the “Queen of Sheba.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Prometheus” overture, a product of Goldmark’s
maturity, is a superb work, one of the
most admirable produced in recent years, and one
that ought to live. The composer has chosen some
of the salient features of Æschylus’s sublime tragedy,
and has expressed them eloquently. The opening
measures speak of the loneliness of the chained
Prometheus, surrounded by the empty infinity of
space. A beautiful theme in the wood is said to
signify the prostrate god’s hope, but such an interpretation
is not justified by the tragedy. The writer
prefers to regard it as an expression of the repose
of the sea, whence floats up a few measures later the
sympathetic chorus of sea-nymphs, represented by
two themes, one a lovely undulating melody in the
wood, the other, speaking more eloquently of their
yearning over Prometheus, a flowing melody for the
strings. The bold, restless spirit of the god is finely
expressed by the allegro, with which the sea-nymph
music is worked out in effective contrast. An increase
in tempo and a change in the melody near
the end of the work lead to a forcible proclamation
of Jove’s sentence by the trombones, and the whole
closes with the music of space and the sea. In
form, in instrumentation and in elaboration, as well
as in emotional content, the overture is noble.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Penthesilea” overture is founded on the
Homeric episode of the emotion of Achilles over the
beautiful corpse of the Amazon queen, slain by him
in battle. The composition is very clear in purpose
and is well written. The “Spring” overture is the
least striking of the works under consideration, yet
it displays much of the composer’s mastery of orchestral
technique.</p>

<p class='c007'>Goldmark’s music, on the whole, is distinguished
by a deep and manly warmth, a restless aggressiveness
and a hyperbolic instrumental language. In
this latter respect it resembles Eastern poetry in the
extravagance of its forms of expression, at times
approaching bombast. At his best, however, as in
the “Prometheus” overture, the composer is capable
of strong, serious, lofty feeling, noble dignity of
utterance and reposeful symmetry of form. It is
because this overture exhibits these powers of Goldmark
in a higher form than his other compositions
that the present writer looks upon it as his greatest
work. His operas are eclectic in style and the result
is something between Meyerbeer and Wagner;
but in his overtures the individuality of Goldmark
is most clearly revealed. Admirable as much of his
chamber music is, it suffers by comparison with his
larger works because of the lack of those instrumental
colors which the composer uses with such
dazzling effect. It is impossible to predict the future
of Goldmark’s music; but it certainly belongs
to the present, and some of it seems likely to live.</p>

In the latter part of the nineteenth
century probably no composer has
done more for the development of
the chorus, and especially of the
<em>Maennerchor</em>, than Max Bruch, and
although he has achieved much in
orchestral scoring, and has written fine concertos,
symphonies, and even large operas, it is upon his
great choruses that his fame as a composer, and
his right to admission to the ranks of the masters,
chiefly rests. He was born in Cologne, Jan. 6,
1838, and his musical powers developed very early,
for by the time that he had reached his fourteenth
year, he had already written upwards of seventy
compositions, although wisely forbearing to print
them and thereby take rank as a “musical prodigy.”
One of these juvenile works was a symphony, and
received a public performance in Cologne in 1852.
As with the first compositions of Mendelssohn,
however, these early works are to be regarded
merely as records of juvenile possibilities and are
not reckoned with the great and serious contributions
to music which Bruch was able to make in
riper years.</p>

<p class='c007'>His parents gladly aided his efforts to develop
his musical abilities by thorough training, and to
his mother he owes much of the success of his juvenile
studies. This lady, once famous as Fräulein
Almenräder, was herself a distinguished singer, and
came of a well-known musical family of the lower
Rhine country. She personally attended to the elementary
steps of Bruch’s musical curriculum, but he
was early sent to Professor Heinrich Karl Breidenstein
of Bonn, who took charge of his theoretical
studies. These succeeded so well that the compositions
of the nine-year-old boy attracted the notice
of Ferdinand Hiller, who soon after took him in
charge and developed his abilities so rapidly
and thoroughly that at fourteen years the boy
was able to enter for the Mozart scholarship
awarded in Frankfort. The string quartette
which he wrote for this occasion won the prize.
This obtained for him a yearly <i><span lang="la">stipendium</span></i> of
four hundred gulden, which he enjoyed for four
years, and which enabled him to continue his
studies with Hiller, and also to obtain instruction
from Professors Carl Reinecke and Ferdinand
Breuning, studying piano under the latter
with especial zeal and success. Long visits to
Munich, Leipsic and other musical centers followed,
and continued to broaden the musical horizon
of the young genius. At Munich he made
the personal acquaintance of the poet Emanuel
Geibel, who had much influence upon his later
work in the large musical forms. The winter of
1857–8, passed in Leipsic, seems to have also
wielded a great influence in awakening Bruch’s
enthusiasm for the higher walks of music. After
this year, we find him once more in his native
city of Cologne, enjoying a reputation which even
at that time was much more than local. He had,
until this time, published only compositions in the
small forms, piano pieces, songs, and duets, but
with his first two choruses we find the first ocular
evidences of talent, and from the very beginning
the massing of voices seems to have possessed a
peculiar charm for, and to have been well understood
by him.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1862, after the death of his father, Bruch began
a two-years’ stay in Mannheim, and his friendship
with Vincenz Lachner, which began at this
time, undoubtedly had an influence on his compositions.
In 1865, he went to Coblentz to assume the
directorship of the musical institute there, and
this was the beginning of the period of his greatest
creative activity. In 1867, he became director
of the court orchestra in Sondershausen, a position
which had been held by such masters as
Spohr and Weber, and for three years we find
him diligently perfecting himself in the art of
conducting, in which he has become very celebrated,
being one of the few composers who are
successful on the conductor’s stand. In 1870,
Bruch went to Berlin, where he lived some years,
not accepting any position, but busying himself entirely
with composition. After this he settled in
Bonn for a short time. In 1878 he was called
to Berlin to succeed
Julius Stockhausen as
director of the famous
Stern Gesangverein. His
next engagement took
him across the seas, and
he went to Liverpool to
succeed Sir Julius Benedict
as director of the
Philharmonic society in
1880. This engagement
ended in the Spring of
1883 (some biographies
commit an error
here, in setting the date
a year earlier), and he
immediately came to
America where he conducted
a number of his
compositions. In the
summer of 1883 he
returned to Germany,
and from September of
that year he was the
director of the Breslau
Orchestral Society.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>MAX BRUCH<br>  <br>  From a wood engraving at the British Museum.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This continued until the spring of 1890, when he
closed his labors as conductor and settled in Friedenau,
near Berlin, where he is at present; but he is
so fond of travel, so
full of energy and activity,
that he is not likely
to remain in retirement
very long. In 1890
he received the honorary
title of Royal Professor.</p>

<p class='c007'>In personal appearance
Bruch is by no
means as majestic as
one would suppose from
his works. He is small
of stature, and his dark
eyes peer through his
spectacles with the
sharp glance of a
teacher rather than of
a creator of heroic
cantatas. He is quick
and nervous in motion
and, when directing an
orchestra or chorus, his
gestures are spontaneous
and expressive.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is pleasant to notice that the juvenile compositions
of Bruch had their origin in filial affection and
that one of the earliest of his works is a prayer for
his parents, which the nine-year-old boy arranged
as a song. But the actual career of the composer
commenced with the choruses, which he began to
write in his twenty-first year.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first of these choruses (Op. 8) bore the
title of “Birken und Erlen” (“Birches and Alders”),
and the second (Op. 3) “Jubilate, Amen.”
In both of the works a soprano voice is used <em>obligato</em>
against four-part chorus, and there are not only rich
harmonies, but a wonderful blending of the solo with
the chorus part. Just before these works, Bruch had
written a little one-act opera, his Opus I, entitled
“Scherz, List, und Rache,” on Goethe’s libretto,
but it made no very marked impression; soon after,
however, he turned his attention to larger opera, and
the result was that Emanuel Geibel’s libretto,
“Loreley,” which had been written years before,
for Mendelssohn (that master was at work upon
this subject when he met his early death), was now
brought to the operatic stage by him. At first the
poet opposed the thought of presenting the work
save on the concert platform, but finally consented
to allow it a trial at the theatre of Mannheim. The
opera deals with one of the most poetical conceptions
of the Rhine-witch, which makes her appear
at first as a pure and beautiful maiden, named
Leonore, but heartbroken and frenzied by betrayal
and desertion, she seals a bond with the spirits of
the stream, and with them wages war on mankind.
Mendelssohn had already composed the scene of
the invocation of the river-demons, and the festival
of the vintagers, and Bruch’s music to these scenes
bears the test of comparison, which is saying much
when it is considered that the earlier setting was the
last work of the more celebrated composer, and this
was composed at the beginning of Bruch’s career.
Bruch’s “Vintage Chorus” is frequently given
by male choruses as a concert selection. The performance
at Mannheim was successful and the opera
was afterwards presented at many other theatres, and
notably at Hamburg and Leipsic, in both of which
cities it won great applause from public and press.
Yet the work has now totally disappeared from the
stage, since it is not really a dramatic subject, the
change of the heroine from an innocent and confiding
maiden to a fierce and revengeful spirit, a
first cousin to the Greek Sirens, is rather a metaphysical
than a theatrical one, and the plot occasioned
some repetition of style which weakened the music.
About ten years later Bruch once more essayed opera,
and failed. This time Shakespeare was the librettist,
and under the title of “Hermione” the new work,
which was the “Winter’s Tale,” was performed in
Berlin and Dresden, but in neither city did it win
more than a <i><span lang="fr">succès d’estime</span></i>. It has disappeared
from the repertoire altogether, yet the second act is a
gem that will bear rescuing from oblivion. It represents
Hermione in prison, and at her trial, and so well
is the pathos and intensity of the music fitted to the
situation, that it is not exaggeration to speak of this
portion of the opera as being among the finest things
that Bruch has ever written, and it may be ranked
with the very best of modern music.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We now approach the epoch when Bruch produced
a work which at once drew the attention, not
of Germany alone, but of the entire musical world
towards his labors; we have intimated that the composer’s
fame rests chiefly on what he has done for
chorus singing, and it is in the treatment of male
chorus that Bruch is unsurpassed; it was with
such a work,—“Frithjof” (Op. 23),—that he
won his first great triumph. The text, by Esaias
Tegner, taken from the grand old Sagas, afforded a
sombre dignity that suited well to a massive use of
<em>maennerchor</em>, and once more Bruch added a female
voice, not in combination, but rather in contrast to
the chorus work, to illustrate the character of the unhappy
Ingeborg. The baritone solos, the utterances
of the viking Frithjof, are full of expression, and the
chorus of the returning heroes at the beginning of the
cantata is melodious in the highest degree. Seldom,
in a modern work, has so much of melody been employed,
without weakening the dramatic treatment,
but the final chorus of the departing warriors may
be cited as a perfect example of this happy combination
in Bruch’s choruses. “Frithjof” may also
stand as a model of condensation in dramatic music;
every note has its purport, and there is not a measure
in the entire work that is supererogatory. The
contrasts are also managed with a master-hand, so
that the emotions of peace and war are given in
kaleidoscopic, yet logical, succession.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately following this there came an almost
equally important contribution to the repertoire of
mixed chorus; this was “Schön Ellen,” a cantata
for chorus combined with soprano and baritone
solos. The subject taken was again a warlike one,
being founded on the fabulous tale invented by a
newspaper correspondent, that during the siege of
Lucknow, a Scotch girl named Jessie Brown heard
the bagpipes of the regiments sent to the relief of
the place, long before they were audible to the rest
of the garrison, and was able thereby to prevent a
surrender to the merciless Sepoys surrounding it.
Emanuel Geibel, the poet, turned the mythical Jessie
Brown into an equally mythical “Fair Ellen,”
and gave the libretto to the composer, who began
its composition within sound of the cannon at the
battle of Sadowa the culmination of the Austro-Prussian
war. The subject was full of dramatic possibilities,
and Bruch used these in the condensed
manner characteristic of the preceding work. Naturally
he was impelled towards Scotch music by the
color of the poem, and the entire cantata is founded
on “The Campbells are comin’,” which is omnipresent
in it, and forms a grand climax to the whole as
a hymn of thanksgiving. Yet many may have blamed
Bruch for departing from the Scotch character of
the theme in this lofty finale; few musicians will
join in this censure, for the composer has but allowed
himself the freedom of the Fantasie in this
development of a folk-theme. It is not the only
time that a German composer has used this melody
in a developed musical work, for Robert Volkmann
employed it in his overture “Richard III.”; a Scotch
theme written in 1568, in an English battle fought
in 1485!</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be fitting in this place to speak of the
influence which the Scotch folk-music exerted upon
Bruch. He once assured the writer of this article
that he was familiar with over four hundred of the
Scotch folk-songs. After the completion of “Fair
Ellen” his taste in this direction was again shown
in the “Scotch Fantasie” (Op. 46) for violin
and orchestra, which is one of Sarasate’s favorite
solos, and he also arranged twelve Scotch folk-songs
with considerable success. Yet it may
fairly be doubted whether Bruch has ever been
able to reproduce the lilt so characteristic of Gaelic
music; in this failure, however, he is not alone, for
Beethoven, Schumann, and others among the German
masters have attempted this vein fruitlessly;
Mendelssohn alone, among the ranks of these,
accomplished the transplanting of the delicate
flower of Scotch folk-music into German classical
works.</p>

<p class='c007'>The immense success that followed the production
of “Frithjof,” and the almost equal favor extended
to “Fair Ellen,” was reflected on Bruch’s
earlier works, and the “Roman Song of Triumph”
(Op. 19, No. 1) was brought into popularity in its
wake, and once more we hear the stern notes of
war and victory sounding in the massive chords of
the male chorus. Soon after the triumph of “Frithjof”
we find the composer returning to the subject,
and Op. 27 deals with “Frithjof at the grave of his
father,” but it was like Milton’s “Paradise Regained”
after “Paradise Lost,” a weak work after a
masterpiece, and this concert-scene for baritone
solo, female chorus, and orchestra, fell rather flat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The true successor of “Frithjof” was to come
later in the shape of another warrior, this time a
Grecian; in the “Odysseus,” Op. 41, with Ulysses
as his hero, we find the composer rising to the
height of the preceding subject, but in another
and less stern manner. This had been preceded
by yet another tone-picture of warriors, in the
“Normannen-zug,” a stately union of baritone
solo, with unison male chorus and orchestra
(all the above-mentioned cantatas have orchestral
accompaniment) but in “Odysseus” all the resources
of modern scoring are employed and both
mixed and male choruses are present in most
effective numbers. “Odysseus” exhibits Bruch’s
instrumentation in the best light, and proves him a
master of the modern orchestral resources. These
instrumental forces are always employed with the
most perfect taste, and the accompaniment of the
great unison male chorus of the Rhapsodes by tremendous
pizzicato chords, as of a giant harp, is a
touch of indescribable dignity; some of the finest
mixed choruses which the composer has written are
to be found in this work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other large compositions for solo voices, chorus,
and orchestra, followed. “Arminius” (this time a
German warrior was the hero) may not be ranked
with the inspired works mentioned above, but is
nevertheless a favorite with the composer, and all
creators in art have the privilege of loving their
weakest children best; “The Song of the Bell,” on
Schiller’s great poem, although a fine work, full of
power and majesty, does not bring out all the
dramatic possibilities of the subject, but is never-less
far more effective than the Romberg setting;
“Achilleus” (again a martial theme) is one of
the most recent works of the master, and in his Op.
52 he turns again to Scotia and in the “Fiery
Cross” we find Sir Walter Scott’s “Lady of the
Lake” appearing in some of its warlike phases.</p>

<p class='c007'>So much for the chief vocal works of this master;
it will be seen that he loves historic pictures, and
the poets Geibel, Lingg, and Scheffel have helped
him by libretto and advice in this direction; and
he sings so constantly of war and warriors, that he
may be called the Tyrtæus of modern music. But
it must not be supposed that his entire work has
been in this field only; he has won much success
in some of the large instrumental forms as well.
His three symphonies in E flat, F minor, and E
major, are but seldom performed, but it is difficult
to discover the cause of this neglect; possibly the
earnest, sombre, even gloomy tints of the second
are not to the taste of those who seek only pleasure
in music. But the third symphony in E is genial
and attractive and would please almost any cultured
audience although it is not in the strictest form.
The first two symphonies are built in classical style,
and Bruch seems to have taken Beethoven for his
model in this field. It must be confessed, however,
that none of the three works has yet received due
appreciation. Vastly different is it with the two
violin concertos, the first of which is dedicated to
Joachim, the second to Sarasate; these are very
frequently heard in our concert rooms and the first,
(in G minor, Op. 26) may be mentioned as one of
the chief works in this form, and equal, and by some
held superior, to Mendelssohn’s well-known violin
concerto.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third violin concerto is scarcely known yet in
America. It was played at the music festival of
Düsseldorf, by Joseph Joachim, with great success.
It has a dreamy, prayerful, second movement, and
a most martial and brilliant finale, but its first movement
is prolix when compared with the power of the
themes of the G minor concerto.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be of interest to append a list of the most
important of Bruch’s published compositions; they
are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 1. “Scherz, List und Rache.” (Goethe.) A comic
opera in one act.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 3. “Jubilate, Amen.” For Soprano, Chorus and Orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 8. “The Birches and the Alders.” Soprano solo, Chorus
and Orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 9. String Quartette. C minor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 10. Quartette in E major. (Both rather too broad in
their ideas for the vehicle of expression.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 12. Six pieces for Piano. (Simple, yet beautiful in expression,
and showing the composer in a very different
field from that of his majestic cantatas.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 16. “Loreley.” Grand romantic opera.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 19. “Römischer Triumphgesang”; “Wessobrunner Gebet.”
Male choruses with orchestra; the first has become
celebrated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 20. “The Flight of the Holy Family.” (Libretto by
Eichendorff.) A great work for Chorus and Orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 22. Does not exist! By a clerical error the Frithjof
music was numbered Opus 23 instead of 22.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 23. “Frithjof.” (See above.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 24. “Schön Ellen”: “Fair Ellen.” (See above.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 25. “Salamis.” Words by Lingg. Male Chorus and
Orchestra. One of the large choral works; a grand historical
tone-poem.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 26. Violin Concerto. No. 1. G minor. (See above.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 27. “Frithjof at his Father’s Grave.” Baritone. Female
Chorus and Orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 28. Symphony in E flat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 29. “Rorate Coeli.” Chorus, Orchestra, and Organ.
Probably this is the loftiest of Bruch’s sacred works.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 31. “The Flight into Egypt,” and “Morning Hours.”
(By Lingg.) Soprano, Female Chorus and Orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 32. “Normannen-zug.” Baritone, Chorus in unison and
Orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 34. “Römische Leichenfeier”: “Roman Funeral Sacrifice.”
Mixed Chorus and Orchestra. (Has been erroneously
classified as a male chorus.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 35. “Kyrie, Sanctus and Agnus Dei.” Choral work.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 36. Symphony in F minor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 37. “Song of the German Emperor.” Chorus and Orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 39. “Dithyrambe.” (Schiller.) Tenor voice, Chorus
and Orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 40. “Hermione.” (“Winter’s Tale.”) Grand Opera.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 41. “Odysseus.” (See above.)</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 43. “Arminius.” A large work for Chorus and Orchestra.
Sometimes classified as an oratorio.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 44. Violin Concerto. No. 2. D minor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 45. “The Song of the Bell.” (Schiller.) Chorus, four
solo voices, Orchestra and Organ. This is the most ambitious
work of the composer; by some it is accounted his
greatest, but whoever undertakes the setting of this masterpiece
of a great poet, will find his music overshadowed
by the grandeur of the poetry.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 46. Scotch Fantasie. Violin and Orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 47. “Kol Nidrei.” A wonderfully effective setting of
the ancient Hebrew hymn (many believe this to be the
oldest piece of Hebrew music in existence) for Violoncello
and Orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 50. “Achilleus.” Solo voice, Chorus and Orchestra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Op. 51. Third Symphony. E major. The most free in

Most of the more or less prominent
German composers of the present
time may be easily divided in
two different classes. On one
side we may place those who
seem to be all their lives in a period
of “Sturm und Drang;” who are always bitterly
in earnest, ever appearing either melancholy or
passionate, always longing and striving for the
unattainable, often mournful, despairing and reticent.
These composers present, even in their
normal state, gloomy D minor physiognomies, quite
in harmony with the prevailing pessimistic philosophy.
On the opposite side are those who look
more at the bright and sunny side of life and art,
who are the good friends and neighbors of their
fellow beings, with simpler, quieter feelings, perhaps
also with less high, less far fetched aspirations, and
who are less anxious to introduce in every work
some new and original feature. The musical
physiognomies of this class reflect more the peaceful
F, the lively D or the festive E flat keys. To
be sure, this is rather a queer and fanciful
generalization of the truth, and the most remarkable
exceptions could be named on either side, both
in regard to the sincerity of such domineering
tendencies and to the degree of acquired knowledge
and ability or inborn talent of the respective
composers. There are particularly some of the
second class, to whom art is as high and sacred as
it is to the others, and who are worthy of a more
prominent position, owing to the possession of
rare creative powers and a complete mastery in the
use of old and modern means of musical expression,
as well as of all the different forms of composition.
Such a master is Rheinberger. Joseph Gabriel
Rheinberger was born the 17th of March, 1839,
being the son of a revenue officer in Vaduz, the
small capital of the principality of Lichtenstein,
between Switzerland and Tyrol. At a very early
age it became evident that nature had destined for
him a musical career. He was not five years old,
when the piano lessons of his eldest sister attracted
his attention in a way which induced her teacher to
also begin a musical instruction with the little boy;
and so great and rapid was his progress, both on
the pianoforte and the organ, that after two years
he was competent to fill the position of organist
at the church. Even his productive instincts
manifested themselves in these tender years, and
the little tot of eight years was allowed to have a
short mass in three parts with organ accompaniment
of his own composition performed at church.
Thus his musical vocation was beyond all question,
and fortunately the best possible professional
education was granted to him very early in life.</p>

<p class='c007'>From 1851 till 1854 young Rheinberger was a
pupil of the Royal Conservatory at Munich, having
as teachers Leonard for the pianoforte, Herzog for
the organ, and Maier for composition. Since then
the Bavarian capital has been Rheinberger’s second
home. When he had graduated with high honors,
he took his permanent residence there as a music
teacher, and in 1859 was appointed Leonard’s
successor at the Conservatory, which was then
directed by Hauser, the famous baritone and vocal
teacher. Later on he began teaching composition,
a work in which he has won particular distinction.
In 1865 Hauser was pensioned, the conservatory
reorganized, and Rheinberger appointed as solo-repetitor
of the Opera, but in 1867, when Bülow
assumed the directorship of the newly organized
“Royal Music School,” Rheinberger again received
a call as Professor and Inspector at the new
institution. This position he has held ever since,
teaching composition and organ. For many years
he has also conducted the Munich Oratorio Society,
and after Wüllner’s departure in 1877, for some
time he led the choir of the Royal Chapel, which
was once so justly celebrated for its marvelous
rendering of unaccompanied choral works, but which
unfortunately has now disappeared from Munich’s
musical life. Rheinberger has been the recipient
of many honors, titles and orders, and is an honorary
member of the Berlin Academy of fine Arts,
and of numberless choral societies in and outside
of Germany. Yet he has found the most intimate
sympathizer with his artistic work in his wife, the
poetess Franziska von Hoffnaass, who has written
the text to so many of his best known choral
works.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Munich has been Rheinberger’s home since
boyhood, it may be interesting to examine the
influence, which the life in this metropolis of
arts, sciences, literature, music and drama, must
necessarily have had upon the development of
his talents. It is well known how much the
musical life of Munich has changed during the
last thirty years. At the time of Rheinberger’s
arrival there, Franz Lachner stood in the zenith
of his long musical career; he was the highly
respected, influential General Music Director of
Bavaria and a representative of the old strictly
methodical art of composition, and of the old-fashioned,
strictly objective mode of rendering
the works of the classic masters in the field of opera
and concert. Twelve years later King Max II., who
had surrounded himself with eminent poets, artists
and scientists, was succeeded by Ludwig II., the
young enthusiastic admirer of R. Wagner and his
ideas. The great opera reformer was invited to
live in Munich and his ardent pupil Bülow was
appointed as court pianist and director of the
orchestra and of the new Music School. How
soon master and pupil had to leave Munich again
every one knows. Nevertheless their powerful
influence remained, especially at the Royal opera
house, which became the headquarters of Wagner’s
music-dramas. The change in the concert life
was slower. Gradually the musicians and the
public were forced to become accustomed to
Brahms and other modern composers, whose art
rests mainly upon the classical models, till of late
Berlioz and Liszt also have found at last a more
general recognition.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides Lachner, Wagner and Bülow we may
name as the principal representatives of Munich’s
musical life, and the colleagues of Rheinberger
during the last thirty years, Peter Cornelius, the
long neglected composer, intendant and composer
von Perfall, Max Zenger, directors Wüllner, Levi,
Fischer and Porges, the æstheticians Riehl, Nohl
and Carrère, the pianists Baermann and Bussmeyer,
the violinists Walter, Abel, Venzl, all
the famous singers of the opera and many others.
Through his position at the opera and at the Music
School, Rheinberger stood in a close personal and
active relation to almost all these men, as well as
to this transformation of the musical life of Munich.
Yet it certainly speaks very well in his favor, and
honors both the originality of his talent and his artistic
character, that under all these circumstances he
has never been untrue to himself and his individuality,
has never stepped beyond his sphere nor
trodden a path unsuited to him. An early knowledge
of his own nature happily protected him, and
his early acquired thorough technical and theoretical
education stood him in good stead.</p>

<p class='c007'>A review of Rheinberger’s published compositions
shows at once his great versatility; no field
was neglected by him, in many he has written
excellent works, in others, if he did not reach the
same degree, at least his musical skill and fine
musicianship awaken our sincere interest and high
consideration. If he was not in every work guided
by inspiration, his rare knowledge, ability and
artistic instinct preserved him against failure or
triviality. Even in his compositions of smaller
forms the hand of a master is always to be recognized.
What a truly musical character have his
themes, how clever and tasteful is his use of all the
different instrumental or vocal means, how broad
and melodic his cantilena, how fine and charmingly
rich and varying his modulations, how fresh and
energetic his rhythm, how well does he understand
how to find the right tone for the intended mood,
and how carefully are all the details finished and
connected into a most harmonious whole! Often
his pieces give the impression that the composer
had really found the truest expression and most
beautiful form for what he wished to say or illustrate.
Certain chamber works, piano or organ
pieces, are so delightful, that they awaken a desire
for their immediate repetition, and there are quite
a number of his choral compositions which one
cannot hear or sing often enough.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a sincere Catholic, Rheinberger has contributed
very considerably to the sacred literature of
his church, these works being directly intended
for the service more than for concert purposes.
They are partly in a plain, easy style, and
partly on a grander scale, where the composer
found ample opportunity to show his complete
mastery of contrapuntal and polyphonic art, especially
of the fugue. Yet he
always keeps himself free
from uninteresting features
and all mere exhibition of
learning. A mood of pious
devotion prevails in these
works, among the large number
of which special mention
must be made of the great
mass for double chorus, dedicated
to Pope Leo XIII.,
two settings of the Stabat
Mater and the Requiem for
the victims of the war of
1870–71; besides many
hymns and motets. Of even
greater importance are
Rheinberger’s compositions
for the musical instrument of
the church, the organ. His
many sonatas, belong to the
most valuable contributions
to organ literature. They
have the usual three or four
movements, an intermezzo
taking the place of the less appropriate scherzo, and a
great fugue forming the finale. And they are by no
means tedious, antiquarian imitations of old masters,
but are full of warm, modern sentiment, in
spite of the strictness of form bearing a thoroughly
modern physiognomy, yet never going beyond the
limits of dignity, becoming this sacred instrument.
Some movements have become especially famous
and are favorite numbers of organ recitals, as
for instance, the Passacaglia of No. 8. Not less
valuable are the many monologues and fughettes
and the organ concerto with accompaniment of
strings and horns.</p>

<p class='c007'>A review of Rheinberger’s pianoforte compositions
may justly be opened with his beautiful
concerto in A flat, dedicated to Carl Baermann.
It is written in a truly symphonic style and contains
throughout in its three extended movements noble
and sympathetic music, rich in colors, contrasts
and climaxes, the orchestra accompaniment being
raised to great importance, yet the solo part
always remaining brilliant and effective, especially
in the splendid cadenza. The same thorough
mastery of the classic forms also appears in several
of the great sonatas for either two or four hands;
yet the old forms breathe
all the modern romantic
spirit and even their construction
occasionally shows
modern influences. Particularly
interesting is the great
“symphonic sonata,” opus
47, with a charming minuet
and a magnificent tarantella
in the last movement, the
entire work betraying quite a
distinct influence of Brahms
and his early sonatas. In
tarantellas Rheinberger has
been as fertile as successful,
illustration being found in
the violin sonata in E flat
and in several independent
piano works for two, four, or
even eight hands. This happy
combination of old strict
forms with modern expression
and feeling is also the distinguishing
feature of his several
toccatas, some of which
require a great virtuosity of playing. And thus it
is with his Fugues, Capriccios, Gavottes, Scherzinos,
Etudes, etc., while many other pieces such as
Humoresken, Romances, Mazurkas or the collections
“From Italy” and “Vacation Pieces” remind
us more of the character-pieces which Mendelssohn
and Schumann had cultivated. With a Scherzoso
and Capriccio on a theme by Handel, Rheinberger
paid a special tribute to his admiration of the genius
of Brahms, whereas a most interesting improvisation
on themes from Mozart’s “Magic Flute” bears
some resemblance to Liszt’s virtuoso style, yet
showing a decidedly better musical workmanship</p>

<p class='c007'>In looking at Rheinberger’s chamber works we
at once admire his complete familiarity with the
old quartet style, and his eminent skill in counterpoint,
but these do not hide the bright, charming,
sympathetic character of his music, the energetic
life of the allegros, the broad, smooth, coherent
cantilena of the slow movements, and the grace
and spirit of the Scherzos. Beauty of feeling and
sound go most happily hand in hand. Of the two
violin sonatas in E flat major and E minor the
former has become particularly well known, and
the effective treatment of this string instrument
makes us regret that Rheinberger has never written
a complete violin concerto in a great symphonic
style. He has, however, composed several suites
for violin or violoncello with organ.</p>

<p class='c007'>In E flat major, which is apparently a favorite
key with our master, are the splendid and justly
famous pianoforte quartet, opus 38, and the more
recently written nonet for horn, four string and
four wood instruments. Besides these there are
three pianoforte trios, a great pianoforte quintet
in C, a string quintet in A minor, variations for
five strings, and his latest contribution to this class
of music, the string quartet in F. This very
remarkable and noble production is distinguished
by the most masterly treatment of attractive themes,
by the charm and grace of the middle movements
and an unsurpassed skill in the closing fugue.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not surprising, that a composer of such
prominent qualities both in regard to the mastery
of the old sonata form and the excellent use of
the different instruments, has written some works
for complete orchestra; rather are we surprised
that he has not cultivated this field more. However
his works of this kind are certainly not his
best and it is not unlikely that a clear estimation
of his own powers has prevented him from further
attempts in this field. Of his two symphonic works
the more recent one entitled “Florentine Symphony”
is far less known and appreciated than the
symphonic tone-picture, “Wallenstein,” which was
composed much earlier. Both in the old and new
world this work still appears in concert programmes,
the part performed most frequently being the
fascinating Scherzo “Wallenstein’s Camp” with
the amusing sermon of the garrulous capuchin in
the trio. The opening Allegro is superscribed
“Prelude,” the adagio “Thekla,” the finale “Wallenstein’s
Death.” The latter is unduly long, and
without the help of a direct programme hardly
comprehensible and enjoyable. In spite of the
undeniably noble and high purpose, the marked
skill in technical respects and the truly musical
character of the thematic material, we doubt
whether Rheinberger, an ever growing representative
of old theories and absolute music, would
to-day write another such programmatic work.
The above mentioned passacaglia for organ, has,
in a most magnificent orchestral arrangement,
found a very sympathetic reception in many
concert rooms, and quite often one reads of
performances of his overtures to Shakespeare’s
“Taming of the Shrew,” and to Schiller’s “Demetrius.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We now approach the theatre, for which Rheinberger
has also written. He was once connected
in a practical way with the operatic stage, and at
that time composed the incidental music to dramas
of Raimund and Calderon, as well as a great romantic
fairy opera, “The Seven Ravens.” The writer
remembers with pleasure an excellent performance
of this delightful work at the Munich Opera House,
though it was many years ago. There was a wealth
of beautiful, delicate or strong music full of poetry
and romanticism of a truly fairy character, yet not
lacking in stronger dramatic emotions. This
work was followed later on by a comic opera,
“Thürmer’s Töchterlein,” which was quite successfully
given on the Munich stage. The preludes of
both operas are often heard in orchestral concerts.
One of Rheinberger’s most recent works is a
little “Singspiel” for young folks, in two acts,
with piano accompaniment, “das Zauberwort.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At last we reach in our review the field, in which
Rheinberger has been especially fertile and successful,
his many choral compositions. As a writer
of chorus-ballads, he occupied a similar high position
as that held by Loewe for solo ballads, and as
by far the worthiest successor of Schumann and
Gade, if not in some respects their superior. His
choral works afford ample opportunity to admire his
fine sense for novel, charming vocal effects, for a correct,
grateful and always effective treatment of the
human voice, a careful finishing of details, a great
variety of colors and a distinct and fine characterization
of the various moods of the poems.
Whenever a piano or orchestra accompaniment is
added, it is most refined, truly musical, and
adequately arranged. Many such happy features
could be quoted, but it is impossible to enter
further into details. Most of these works do
not require a very large chorus or the mastery
of unusual difficulties, and have therefore justly
become favorites with smaller choral societies.
Others however, particularly those for male voices,
demand numerous, well-trained voices and a very
thorough study, as their difficulties are quite
extraordinary.</p>

<p>Fac-simile autograph manuscript written by Jos. Rheinberger in Munich in 1891.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Of the large works for mixed chorus, soli and
orchestra, we mention the often sung cycle of
romances, “Toggenburg,” “Montfort” (a saga
from the Rhine), “Christoforus” (an old Christian
legend), and his latest work, “The Star of Bethlehem,”
a Christmas cantata, the words of all of
which were written by Rheinberger’s wife, Fanny
von Hoffnaass. Less extensive and with only a
pianoforte accompaniment are “King Erich,”
“The Willow Tree,” “The Water Sprite,” “The
Shepherdess from the Country,” “The Dead Bride,”
“May Dew,” “Harald,” “Night,” etc. Of smaller
part songs for mixed voices we mention those
contained in the collection, “Love’s Garden,” and
some sacred hymns. Those for male voices are of
greater prominence and rise far above the plane
of the conventional “Liedertafel” style. They are
true works of art in every respect, of a very noble,
interesting and impressive musical character, sweet
and characteristic melodically, richly colored and
surprisingly original harmonically, while each one
is a real tone-picture, clearly reflecting the various
poetical moods and situations. Some, too, are
quite extensive and have a piano or orchestral
accompaniment, such as the wonderful “Valley
of the Espingo,” “The Roses of Hildesheim,”
“Wittekind,” and “St. John’s Eve.” Most of the
part songs, too, are perfect gems of modern male
chorus music, although they are very difficult as
vocal music and require the most careful preparation.
Rheinberger has also written a number of
solo songs, some of which in cyclic form such as
“Love’s Life,” “On the Seashore,” etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>In reviewing this great number of compositions,
we must admit that Rheinberger does not rank as
an epoch-making genius in musical history. But
in sincere admiration and gratitude we recognize
that the latest period of German music is not
wanting in those whose music reflects the sunshine
and serenity of a clear blue sky, the happiness of
a sound heart and refined mind, whose first purpose
it is, by a masterly and thoughtful use of all
musical means of expression, to delight hearers and
performers alike.</p>

<p class='c007'>This, then, is Rheinberger’s position as a composer.
We will not, however, forget to do full
justice to his eminent ability as a teacher, which
enables him to impart to his pupils that thorough
and systematic theoretical education, which must
remain the indispensable basis for the productions
of even the most gifted composers, especially at
a time when many are inclined to parade with
immature experiments of a fiery, but inordinate
imagination, long before the necessary technical
ability corresponds with their enthusiastic, and perhaps
really worthy intentions.</p>

The life of the great German reformer
of the lyric stage is a most
instructive story. In no respect
is it more so than in its illustration
of the fact that genius
sometimes requires development, that the aspirations
of a young man of promise may be altogether
out of the line of the inspirations of maturity.
Wagner began his musical career as the admirer
and imitator of that which was most popular and
facile in the lyric drama, and became at last the
regenerator of that art which some of his early
models had dragged in the mire of time-service
and gain. There seems to have been a special
providence in the utter failure of his inartistic
attempts, which forced him in his despair to write
what was in him without hope of pecuniary reward.
Destiny drove him toward the goal of fame with
the stinging whip of adversity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wilhelm Richard Wagner was born in Leipsic,
May 22, 1813. His father, Friedrich Wagner, a
man of considerable education though simply a
police superintendent, died in October of the same
year of a nervous fever caused by the carnage at
the battle of Leipsic. Left with a family of seven
children, of whom Albert, the oldest, was only
fourteen, the widow married again. Her second
husband was Ludwig Geyer, an actor at the
Dresden Court Theatre. He was a man of artistic
tastes, a poet, and a portrait painter, and withal a
kindly man, who had a fatherly regard for his stepchildren.
After removing with his family to Dresden,
Geyer died in 1821, and Wagner was once
more without a father. The day before his death
Geyer bade little Richard play two simple pieces
which he had learned to strum on the piano, and
said feebly to the mother, “Has he perchance a
talent for music?” The next day, when the stepfather
lay dead, Wagner’s mother said to him, “He
hoped to make something of thee.” And the composer
adds in his autobiographic sketch, “I remember,
too, that for a long time I imagined that
something indeed would come of me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In his ninth year Wagner went to the Kreuzschule,
where he studied Greek, Latin, mythology,
and ancient history, and in secret worshipped
Weber, whom he saw daily passing by. The boy
received some piano lessons, but beguiled his time
with attempts to play “Der Freischütz” overture
with “fearful fingering.” He never became a good
pianist. More important for his future were his
poetic studies. On the death of a schoolfellow he
wrote a lament which was printed. He made a
metrical translation of Romeo’s monologue, and
he built a terrible tragedy, compounded of “Lear”
and “Hamlet,” in which forty-two persons died,
most of them returning as ghosts to finish the play.
In 1828 he left Dresden and entered the Nicolaischule
in Leipsic. At the Gewandhaus concerts
he heard Beethoven’s music. The effect he afterwards
described thus: “One evening I heard,
for the first time, a Beethoven symphony. I then
fell sick of a fever, and when I recovered I found
myself a musician.” He tried to write music for
one of his tragedies, but discovered that he needed
instruction. Gottlieb Müller tried to teach him,
but found his pupil too wilful. His wilfulness,
however, secured the performance of an overture
at the theatre in 1830. The public laughed at it
because of the persistent thumping of the bass
drum. Fortunately he realized his lack of knowledge,
and applied to Theodore Weinlig, cantor at
the Thomasschule. Weinlig led him in the right
direction, and in less than six months dismissed
him as competent to “solve with ease the hardest
problems of counterpoint.” The immediate results
of this course were an overture, applauded at a
Gewandhaus concert, and a symphony in C major,
modelled on Beethoven and Mozart.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1832 he wrote his first opera libretto, “Die
Hochzeit” (“The Wedding”), the music for
which he abandoned after a few numbers. In
1833 he visited his brother Albert, tenor and
stage manager at the Würzburg theatre, and accepted
the position of chorus master. He now
had leisure to write another opera. This was
“Die Feen” (“The Fairies”), founded on Gozzi’s
“La Donna Serpente.” Beethoven, Weber,
and Marschner were his models. The work was
accepted by Ringelhardt, of the Leipsic Theatre,
but not produced. It was resurrected, however,
in 1891, and was performed ten times in
Germany. In 1834, Wagner heard Wilhelmina
Schroeder-Devrient sing in Bellini’s “Montecchi e
Capuletti,” and her power as an actress seems to
have set his mind to work on the possibility of an
intimate union of music with acting. A performance
of “Massaniello,” with its
quick succession of incidents,
completed the formulation of
his idea of the road to success.
As Adolphe Jullien remarks, his
object was “first to imagine an
animated scene of action, then
to write music easy to sing, and
of a nature to catch the public
ear.” He now began his
second opera, “Das Liebesverbot”
(“The Love Veto”),
based on Shakespeare’s “Measure
for Measure,” but so altered
as to become practically a glorification
of free love.</p>

<p>RICHARD WAGNER’S BIRTHPLACE IN LEIPSIC.<br>  <br>  From a photograph.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In 1834 he secured the post
of musical director at the Magdeburg
Theatre, and there, in
the season of 1835–36, he produced
his new work after only
ten days’ rehearsals. The
result was failure, penury, and
debt. In Magdeburg he fell
in love with Wilhelmina Planer,
an actress, and following her
to Königsberg, when she was
engaged there, he became conductor
at the theatre. On
Nov. 24, 1834, they were married.
In 1837 he read Bulwer’s
“Rienzi,” and conceived
the idea of using it as an opera
plot. In the fall of that year
he became conductor at Riga,
where in 1838 he finished his
libretto and began the music.
He now wrote without hope of
an immediate production, but with a view to future
performance at some theatre of large resources.
His mental eye, however, fixed itself on Paris, and
his “Rienzi” began to develop along lines suggested
by the popular composers of the time, Spontini,
Meyerbeer, Bellini, and Rossini. In 1839 he
and his wife started for Paris, by way of London, on
a sailing ship. Stormy weather and the legend of
“The Flying Dutchman,” told by the sailors, sowed
in his mind seed which grew and subsequently blossomed.
At Boulogne he became acquainted with
Meyerbeer, who gave him letters to Parisians of
note in music, and in September, 1839, he arrived
in the French capital.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Das Liebesverbot” was accepted by Jolly,
director of the Renaissance Theatre, which went
into bankruptcy before the work was rehearsed.
Wagner wrote “A Faust Overture,” which also
failed to come to a performance, and other attempts
were fruitless. He was now reduced to
arranging music for a
publisher, and contributing
to a musical journal.
He wrote at this
time some charming
songs and his notable
article, “A Pilgrimage
to Beethoven,” and he
worked hard at his
“Rienzi.” An overture,
“Columbus,” was
played, but was not
liked. He tried to get
a position as a chorus
singer at a small theatre,
but was rejected. In
“the last stage of his
misery,” Meyerbeer arrived,
and Leon Pillet,
under his influence, allowed
Wagner to have
hopes of preparing a
work for the Grand
Opéra. He wrote a
sketch of the book of
“Der Fliegende Holländer”
(“The Flying
Dutchman”), and to his
disgust, Pillet proposed to buy it of him and have
some one else write the music. Finally, reserving
the German rights, he did sell the sketch to Pillet
for five hundred francs. Then he wrote the libretto
and began to compose his own fine music. He
had not composed for so long a time that he doubted
his powers. “As soon as the piano had arrived,”
he writes, “my heart beat fast for very fear; I
dreaded to discover that I had ceased to be a
musician. I began first with the ‘Sailors’ Chorus’
and the ‘Spinning Song’; everything sped along as
though on wings, and I shouted for joy as I felt
within me that I still was a musician.” His sketch,
sold to Pillet, was made into a French opera under
the title of “Le Vaisseau Fantôme,” music by
Dietsch, and failed signally. Wagner, taking no
thought for the future, but working according to his
own artistic impulses, completed his own version in
seven weeks, and began to develop the system
which was to remodel opera. In the mean time
“Rienzi” had been accepted by the Dresden Court
Theatre, and early in 1842 the “Holländer” was
accepted. “As regards
Paris itself,” he writes,
“I was completely without
prospects for several
years; I therefore
left it in the spring of
1842. For the first
time I saw the Rhine;
with hot tears in my
eyes, I, poor artist,
swore eternal fidelity
to my German fatherland.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Rienzi” was produced
on Oct. 20, 1842,
with the following cast:
Rienzi, Tichatschek;
Irene, Frl. Wüst; Stefano,
Dettmer; Adriano,
Mme. Schroeder-Devrient;
Paolo, Wachter;
Raimondo, Rheinhold;
Baroncelli, Vestri;
Cecco, Risse; Messenger,
Frl. Thiele. The
opera achieved an immediate
and emphatic
success, which fifty years
of popularity have approved. “Der Fliegende
Holländer” was now hurried upon the stage, and
produced at Dresden, Jan. 2, 1843, with Schroeder-Devrient
as Senta, and Mitterwurzer as Vanderdecken.
The great change in style from “Rienzi,”
the sombreness of the story, the simplicity of the
action, and the originality of the music surprised and
disappointed the public. Only Spohr seemed to
perceive its real value. He said, “Among composers
for the stage <em>pro tem.</em>, Wagner is the most
gifted.” Spohr produced the “Holländer” at
Cassel on June 5, 1843, and was to the end an
admirer of Wagner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately after finishing this work in Paris,
Wagner cast about for new material. He read a
new version of the story of “Tannhäuser,” which
set him to work to trace to its source the connection
of this tale with that of the Wartburg song
contest. Thus he came to read “Der Wartburgkrieg,”
which introduces the story of “Lohengrin,”
and Wolfram von Eschenbach’s “Parzival”; “and
thus,” as he says, “an entirely new world of poetical
matter suddenly
opened before me.”
Before the rehearsals of
“Rienzi” he began the
book of “Tannhäuser.”
He completed the opera
(though he afterwards
made some changes)
on April 13, 1844. In
the mean time (January,
1843) he was made
court conductor at Dresden,
where he served
seven years, producing
the masterpieces of
Gluck, Mozart, Weber,
Mendelssohn, Beethoven,
Spontini, and even
Palestrina in the most
artistic manner. He
produced “Tannhäuser”
at Dresden,
Oct. 19, 1845, with Tichatschek
in the title
rôle; Schroeder-Devrient
as Venus; his
niece, Johanna Wagner,
as Elizabeth; and Mitterwurzer,
as Wolfram. The work pleased neither
the public nor the critics. The music, except the
simple broad march and chorus of Act. II., was
pronounced ugly. Even the mellifluous “Evening
Star” song was disliked; Tannhäuser’s dramatic
story of his pilgrimage was called “a pointless
and empty recitation,” and Wagner was blamed
for not marrying his hero and heroine. Even
Spohr, though he saw much that was “new
and beautiful,” was troubled. Schumann alone
declared of the work: “It contains deeper, more
original, and altogether an hundred-fold better
things than his previous operas; at the same time,
a good deal that is musically trivial.” Wagner was
discouraged, but instead of losing faith in his ideals,
he decided on a course of literary propagandism:
“to induce the public to understand and participate
in my aims as an artist.” From this resolve sprang
his subsequent theoretical writings: “Art and Revolution”
(1849), “The Art Work of the Future”
(1850), “Opera and Drama” (1851), etc.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Before the production of “Tannhäuser,” he had
made sketches for the
books of “Lohengrin”
and “Die Meistersinger
von Nürnberg” (“The
Mastersingers of Nuremberg”).
He finished
the former work in
March, 1848. In the
mean time failure had
brought debt and
trouble upon him. Even
his wife, though an admirable
woman in other
respects, did not comprehend
his intellect,
and grieved at his preference
of artistic works
over paying operas of
the familiar sort. Restless
and irritated, he
plunged into the revolutionary
movement and
gave utterance to radical
opinions, even arguing
in a lecture that
the king ought to proclaim
Saxony a free
state. In May, 1849,
Dresden streets were barricaded against troops sent
to disperse rioters, and in spite of assertions to the
contrary, there is good evidence that Wagner was
fighting on the people’s side.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c009'><sup>[1]</sup></a> The Prussian troops
scattered the revolutionists, and Wagner fled to
Weimar, where he was received with open arms
by Franz Liszt, thenceforward his most devoted
friend. The police were on his track, however,
and he hastened by way of Paris to Zurich, Switzerland.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wagner’s exile lasted from 1849 till 1861, and
this period embraces the climax of his creative
labors. He began his career as a citizen of Zurich
by pouring forth a long series of literary works, of
which those above mentioned and “Judaism in
Music” may be regarded as the most important.
There will be occasion to speak later of those bearing
on his operatic ideas, but the “Judaism” article
produced bitter comment at the time, and has
remained a source of offence to many. It was published
in the <cite><span lang="de">Neue Zeitschrift für Musik</span></cite>, over the
<em>nom de plume</em> K. Freigedank. The chief contentions
of the article were that the Jews, being of no
nation, but of all nations, are without national feeling;
that their art work, especially in music, lacks
that genuineness which is one of the products of
nationality; and that an instinct for gain causes
them to sacrifice pure art for the profitable fashion
of the time. His examples were Mendelssohn and
Meyerbeer, the latter of whom he again censured
in “Opera and Drama.” The authorship of the
strictures on the Jews was speedily suspected, and a
host of pamphlets appeared in answer to it. The
principal result was that Wagner’s writings sold
well. In a letter written in 1847 he declared that
he esteemed Meyerbeer as a man, but as a composer
viewed him as the embodiment of “all that
is repellent in the incoherency and empty striving
after outward effect of the operatic music of the
day.” This was his only answer to the charge that
he had repaid Meyerbeer’s early assistance with
ingratitude.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>His opera, “Lohengrin,” was produced by Liszt
at Weimar, Aug. 28, 1850, with the following cast:
Lohengrin, Beck; Telramund, Milde; King Henry,
Höfer; Elsa, Frl. Agthe; Ortrud, Frl. Faisstlinger.
It was received very much as “Tannhäuser” had
been, but it gradually won its way through Germany,
being brought out at Wiesbaden in 1853,
Leipzic, Schwerin, Frankfurt, Darmstadt, Breslau,
and Stettin, in 1854; Cologne, Hamburg, Riga, and
Prague, 1855; Munich and Vienna, in 1858; Berlin
and Dresden, 1859. In the mean time Wagner
was laboring on the largest, if not the greatest, of
his works, “Der Ring des Nibelungen” (“The
Nibelung’s Ring”). In 1848 he had considered
two subjects, the story of Frederick Barbarossa and
that of Siegfried, the hero of the “Nibelungen
Lied.” The latter was his choice, and he wrote an
essay entitled “Der Nibelungen Mythus als Entwurf
zu einem Drama” (“The Nibelung Myth as
Subject for a Drama”). Immediately afterward,
in the fall of 1848, he wrote “Siegfried’s Tod”
(“Siegfried’s Death”) in three acts and a prologue,
and even conceived some of the musical ideas for
the setting. In May, 1850, he had this poem
printed and read parts of it as illustrations in a
lecture on the music-drama delivered at Zurich.
The prospects of “Lohengrin” moved him to take
it up again, and we find him writing to Liszt thus:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“You offer to me the artistic association which might
bring ‘Siegfried’ to light. I demand representatives
of heroes, such as our stage has not yet seen;
where are they to come from? Not from the air, but
from the earth, for I believe you are in a good way to
make them grow from the earth by dint of your inspiring
care.... Well, then, as soon as you have
produced ‘Lohengrin’ to your own satisfaction, I shall
also produce my ‘Siegfried,’ but only for you and for
Weimar. Two days ago I should not have believed
that I should come to this resolution; I owe it to
you.”<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c009'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The immediately subsequent letters are full of
his determination soon to begin work on “Siegfried’s
Death”; but when he attempted it, he
found that there was too much explanatory matter,
and he decided to embody that in a prefatory
drama to be called “Young Siegfried.” Here
again, however, he found the same difficulty, and
on Nov. 20, 1851, he writes to Liszt that “this
‘Young Siegfried’ also is no more than a fragment.”
He continues thus:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two principal motives of my myth, therefore, remain
to be represented, both of which are hinted at in
‘Young Siegfried,’ the first in the long narrative of
Brünnhilde after her awakening (Act III.), and the
second in the scene between Alberich and the Wanderer
in the second act, and between the Wanderer and
Mime in the first. That to this I was led not only by
artistic reflection, but by the splendid and, for the purpose
of representation, extremely rich material of these
motives, you will readily understand when you consider
the subject more closely. Think then of the wondrously
fatal love of Siegmund and Sieglinde, of
Wotan, in his deep, mysterious relation to that love,
in his dispute with Fricka, in his terrible self-contention
when, for the sake of custom, he decrees the death of
Siegmund; finally of the glorious Valkyrie Brünnhilde,
as, divining the innermost thought of Wotan, she disobeys
the god, and is punished by him; consider this
wealth of motive indicated in the scene between the
Wanderer and the Wala, and at greater length in the
above-mentioned tale of Brünnhilde, as the material of
a drama which precedes the two ‘Siegfrieds’; and you
will understand that it was not reflection, but rather
enthusiasm, which inspired my latest plan. That plan
extends to three dramas: (1) ‘The Valkyrie’; (2)
‘Young Siegfried’; (3) ‘Siegfried’s Death.’ In order
to give everything completely, these three dramas must
be preceded by a grand introductory play, ‘The
Rape of the Rhinegold.’ The object is the complete
representation of everything in regard to this rape;
the origin of the Nibelung treasure, the possession of
that treasure by Wotan, and the curse of Alberich,
which in ‘Young Siegfried’ occur in the form of narration.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Thus we find him impelled by the demands as
well as the artistic possibilities of a fruitful story to
the construction of his great tetralogy, consisting of
the dramas eventually named “Das Rheingold”
(“The Rhinegold”), “Die Walküre” (“The
Valkyrie”), “Siegfried,” and “Die Götterdämmerung”
(“The Dusk of the Gods”). A further
incentive to the creation of this four-part work was
his belief that the true lyric play should be modelled
after the Greek drama, in whose literature he found
the trilogy of Æschylus—the “Agamemnon,”
“Chœphoræ,” and “Eumenides” and “The
Seven against Thebes,” believed to have been the
final play of a tetralogy. He began to labor at
this gigantic undertaking without any definite hope
of its performance; indeed, with doubts as to his
living to complete it. So great, however, was his
enthusiasm that, in spite of the formidable artistic
problems which he had to solve and the novelty
and complexity of his own musico-dramatic system,
now to be developed for the first time to its logical
outcome, he had the poem completed and printed
for private circulation early in 1853.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c009'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“During the summer of 1853 he visited a place
near Saint Maurice, and from there he undertook a
trip into the North of Italy.... It was during
a sleepless night at Spezzia that the first ideas of
the ‘Rheingold’ music passed through his mind.
He brought his journey to an end, and hastened to
regain his tranquil home at Zurich, that he might
not commence such a work on Italian soil.”<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c009'><sup>[4]</sup></a> The
score of “Das Rheingold” was completed in May,
1854. The next month he began “Die Walküre”
and finished all save the instrumentation in the
winter of 1854–55. The score was done in 1856,
and in 1857 most of the first two acts of “Siegfried”
were composed and orchestrated. His
labors had been interrupted by the production of
“Tannhäuser” at Zurich in 1855, by a visit from
his best of friends, Liszt, and by a journey to London
to conduct the concerts of the Philharmonic
Society from March to June, 1855. He felt that
he must accept this engagement or, as he said in a
letter to Praeger, “renounce the public and all
relations with it once and for all.”<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c009'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A more important interruption, however, was to
come. In 1851, Arthur Schopenhauer’s “Parerga
und Paralipomena” was published, and created a
sensation which called attention to his earlier philosophical
work, “The World as Will and Representation”
(1818), hitherto unnoticed in the glare
of Hegel’s and Schelling’s success. Wagner plunged
into Schopenhauer’s pessimistic philosophy with
ardor. At the same time he was reading Godfrey
von Strassburg’s “Tristan,” and conceived the idea
of embodying Schopenhauer’s pessimism in a story
of unhappy passion. He read Strassburg’s poem
to Praeger, who was visiting him, and spoke of its
adaptability to operatic treatment. The next
morning at breakfast, in a fit of abstraction, he
conceived some of the love music. Now the desire
seized him to write a work which could be completed
and produced. Moreover he needed money.
And to end all, a mysterious agent appeared with a
commission for an opera from the Emperor of
Brazil. Wagner hesitated about the commission,
but he began “Tristan and Isolde.” He finished
the poem early in 1857, the music of the first act in
the winter, the second act in Venice, March 2, 1859,
and the third act in Lyons, August, 1859.</p>

<p class='c007'>In September of the same year he went to Paris
with a faint hope of getting the new work, or one
of his earlier ones, produced. M. Carvalho, of the
Théâtre-Lyrique, was favorably inclined toward
“Tannhäuser,” but afraid. Wagner gave a concert
and lost money. Then help came from an unexpected
quarter. Under the persuasion of the
Princess de Metternich the Emperor ordered a
production of “Tannhäuser” at the Grand Opéra.
The text was translated into French, a great number
of rehearsals was held, $40,000 were spent on
the mounting, and Wagner was allowed to select
his own singers. The cast he chose was as follows:
Tannhäuser, Niemann; Elizabeth, Mlle. Saxe; Venus,
Mlle. Tedesco; the Shepherd, Mlle. Reboux;
the Landgrave, Cazaux; and Wolfram, Morelli. In
his first interview with the director of the Opera,
Wagner was informed that a ballet in the second
act was an absolute necessity, because the subscribers,
chiefly members of the Jockey Club, never
arrived till the middle of the evening, and they
demanded a ballet at that time for their especial
delectation. Wagner refused to introduce a meaningless
dance into his second act, but “saw in the
first act, at the luxurious court of Venus, a most
perfect opportunity for a choreographic scene of
some real meaning.”<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c009'><sup>[6]</sup></a> In accordance with this
idea he rewrote the Venus scene, arranging what is
now known as the Paris version of “Tannhäuser.”
M. Adolphe Jullien’s account of the production on
March 13, 1861, and the ensuing performances
(Chap. VIII.) is careful and candid; and it
settles conclusively the fact that the failure of
the work was due to the persistent opposition
of the members of the Jockey Club, who blew
hunting whistles, indulged in hisses and catcalls,
and otherwise made such a disturbance that the
work did not get a fair hearing. Wagner withdrew
it after three performances, in spite of
the increase of receipts, which ran as follows:
first, 7,491 francs (subscription, 2,790); second,
8,415 francs (subscription, 2,758); third, 10,764
francs (subscription, 230). The smallness of the
subscription at the third performance is accounted
for by its having been given on Sunday night in
order to get rid of the irate subscribers, who,
nevertheless, went <em>en masse</em>, buying admission
tickets. Wagner fully comprehended the meaning
of it all. “Never,” he said, “have I been in the
least disposed to doubt the Parisian public when
it is upon an impartial ground.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Through the intercession of the Princess de Metternich
he received permission in 1861 to return to
Germany. The succeeding three years, owing to
the smallness of the royalties on his operas, were
years of pecuniary distress. His hopes in “Tristan”
were shattered, for after fifty-seven rehearsals
at Vienna it was shelved as impracticable. In 1861
(May 15) at Vienna he had the pleasure of hearing
“Lohengrin” for the first time. He was encouraged
to begin a new work, and he took up his old
sketch of “Die Meistersinger” made in 1845. In
“Tannhäuser” he had drawn a picture of a contest
of song among knightly minnesingers; in this
comic opera he gave a humorous representation of
a contest among the common people. In the
winter of 1861–62 he finished the libretto, though
he afterwards made alterations. He went to a
little place opposite Mayence to work on the music.
He gave a number of concerts to keep the wolf
from the door, and in 1864 published the poem of
“Der Ring des Nibelungen” with a pathetic renunciation
of all hope of living to see it completed or
performed. Pecuniary distress finally broke his
spirit, and in 1864 he accepted an invitation to
live in Switzerland. He was on his way thither
when his earthly providence intervened.</p>

<p class='c007'>This providence was the young King Ludwig II.
of Bavaria, a sincere lover of art and a warm admirer
of Wagner. Hardly had he mounted the
throne before he sent a messenger after the composer
with the words, “Come here and finish your
work.” Wagner’s joy may be imagined. He went
to Munich, where he was provided with a stipend
of $500 a year from the king’s private purse. One
of the musician’s first acts was to compose his
familiar “Huldigungs Marsch” (“March of Allegiance”).
He received the royal order to complete
the “Nibelungen” in the fall of 1864; his
allowance was increased, and a house given him.
The king began to talk about building a theatre for
the production of the tetralogy; “Tristan und
Isolde” was put in preparation, and Hans von Bülow
was summoned to conduct it. On June 10, 1865,
this formidable work was produced in exact accordance
with the composer’s ideas. The original cast
was as follows: Tristan, Ludwig Schnorr von
Carolsfeld; Isolde, Frau Schnorr von Carolsfeld;
King Mark, Zottmayer; Kurvenal, Mitterwurzer;
Melot, Heinrich; Brangäne, Frl. Deinet; Shepherd,
Simons; Steersman, Hartmann. In December,
1865, the composer went to live at the Villa Triebschen,
on Lake Lucerne, where he finished “Die
Meistersinger,” twenty-two years after he had made
the first sketch. It was produced under Von Bülow
at Munich on June 21, 1868, with these principals:
Eva, Frl. Mallinger; Magdalena, Frau Dietz; Hans
Sachs, Betz; Walther, Nachbauer; David, Schlosser;
Beckmesser, Hölzel. While at Triebschen
he also continued his work on the “Nibelungen,”
and in June, 1870, had finished the first act of
“Die Götterdämmerung.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was in this year that he married a second
time. His first wife had never understood his
artistic ideas, and the two were wholly without
sympathy, though Wagner never ceased to speak
with kindness of Mina. His professional intercourse
with Von Bülow led to his intimate acquaintance
with Cosima von Bülow, the daughter
of Liszt. Wagner found in her the comprehension
and sympathy which he craved. Mina was unable
to endure the supremacy of the more brilliant
woman, and in 1861 left her husband and went to
Dresden. She died in 1866, and in 1870, Cosima,
having secured a divorce from Von Bülow, became
Mme. Wagner, destined to survive her husband and
perpetuate his triumphs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now began the remarkable series of events with
which Wagner’s career culminated. The king
abandoned his idea of building a Wagner theatre in
Munich, and the composer selected Bayreuth as a
place adapted, by reason of its seclusion, to the
consummation of his ambitious plans. Money had
to be raised, and Emil Heckel, of Mannheim, conceived
the notion of Wagner Societies. The success
of his scheme was beyond expectation. Such organizations
were founded all over the world—even
in Milan and New York—and more than $200,000
was subscribed. Wagner settled in Bayreuth in
April, 1872, and on May 22 gave a concert to
celebrate the beginning of the building of the
theatre. The music of the tetralogy was finished in
November, 1874, and rehearsals were begun under
Hans Richter. The first performances were given
on Aug. 13, 14, 16, and 17. The work was twice
repeated in the same month. The principals were:
Wotan, Betz; Loge, Vogel; Alberich, Hill; Mime,
Schlosser; Fricka, Frau Grün; Donner and Gunther,
Gura; Erda and Waltraute, Frau Jaïde; Siegmund,
Niemann; Sieglinde, Frl. Schefzky; Brünnhilde,
Frau Materna; Siegfried, Unger; Hagen, Siehr;
Gutrune, Frl. Weckerlin; Rhinedaughters, Frl.
Lili and Marie Lehmann and Frl. Lambert; concert-master,
Wilhemj; conductor, Hans Richter. The
performances, like all successive festivals at Bayreuth,
attracted music lovers from all over the world
and called forth volumes of criticism, favorable and
bitterly unfavorable.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A very large deficit caused Wagner to try the
experiment of grand concerts in London in 1877;
but he made only $3,000 out of that venture.
Wagner’s last work was now well under way. Early
in life, as already noted, he had read Wolfram von
Eschenbach’s “Parzival,” and in 1857, at Zurich,
he began his own “Parsifal,” with a sketch of the
Good Friday music. The completed libretto was
published Dec. 25, 1877. The sketch of the first
act was finished early in 1878, and the whole was
completed April 25, 1879. The instrumentation
was finished at Palermo, Jan. 13, 1882.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c009'><sup>[7]</sup></a> The first
performance took place at Bayreuth on July 25, 1882,
and the work was given altogether sixteen times
that summer. The performers
who alternated in the
principal parts were as follows:
Parsifal, Winklemann,
Gudehus, and Jäger; Kundry,
Materna, Brandt, and
Malten; Gurnemanz, Scaria
and Siehr; Amfortas, Reichmann
and Fuchs; Klingsor,
Hill, Degele, and Plank.
Conductors, Hermann Levi
and Franz Fischer. “Parsifal”
was assailed fiercely
by the now numerous opponents
of Wagner’s musical
system, but it has continued
to draw great crowds to Bayreuth
years after its creator’s
death. The power of this and
the other dramas was due not
only to their inherent truth
and beauty, but also to the
manner of their production. As an American
newspaper correspondent (W. S. B. Mathews)
wrote:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Parsifal,’ as here given, is a revelation. The
performance is of such a consistently elevated
character, and so evenly carried out in every
department, as to make one realize that in his
whole life he has never before witnessed an artistic
presentation of opera.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the autumn of 1882, Wagner went to live in
Venice. His health had been failing. He recuperated
sufficiently to conduct a performance of
his youthful Symphony in C; but on Tuesday,
Feb. 13, 1883, as M. Jullien relates, “as he was
about to step into his gondola, some discussion arose,
and he gave way to a fit of anger; suddenly he
started up from his seat, choking, and cried, ‘I
feel very badly!’ He fell fainting. They carried
him to his bed, and when his physician, Dr.
Keppler, arrived, in all haste, he found him dead
in the arms of his wife, who believed him sleeping.”
On Feb. 18 he was buried in the garden
of his villa, “Wahnfried” (“Fulfillment of Ideal”),
at Bayreuth. He left one son, Siegfried, the
fruit of his second union.</p>

<p class='c007'>This outline of a remarkable
career, in which artistic
success was pursued by pecuniary
embarrassment, in which
envy, malice, and vituperation
barked at the heels of
progressive intellect, will best
be closed by the quotation of
a few lines concerning the
man’s personality. M. Jullien,
who writes with kindness
and yet with candor, says:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The most striking thing
about Richard Wagner, at
first sight, was the extraordinary
life and energy which
animated this insignificant
body, surmounted by a very
large head, with an enormous
frontal development....
His bright eyes and pleasant
glance softened the strongly
marked face, and his mouth, notwithstanding the
undue prominence of nose and chin, had a singular
expression of sweetness and affability. With his
extreme rapidity of movement, gait, and gesture, he
gave from the first an impression of unusual and
powerful originality; he fascinated by his conversation,
so animated was he on all subjects which
interested him, and he always acted out his discourse.
He was violent, even explosive in temper;
with him gayety, like wrath, was tempestuous and
overflowing.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Dannreuther, who knew him well, testifies
that he was most amiable among his friends, with
whom he was a very different person from “the
aggressive critic and reformer who addressed
himself to the public.” There is no doubt that
Wagner was fully convinced of the tremendous
importance of his own work, and that he developed
to its fullest extent the exasperating egotism of
a man whose whole soul is absorbed in his aims.
He was intolerant of opposition, and ungenerous
in his views of other musicians. He was
dogmatic in style, even when most logical in
thought; and like many another genius, he had
some very small weaknesses, such as a sybaritic
love for silk and satin clothing, and a belief that
the world ought to gratefully pay the expenses of
his support while he completed his great works.
With all his peculiarities, which were largely the
outcome of his fierce struggle for recognition, he
possessed “a simple kindness of heart, an extreme
sensibility.” As to his manner of work, Dr.
Praeger has given testimony:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wagner composed at the piano, in an elegantly
well-arranged studio. With him composing
was a work of excitement and much labor....
He labored excessively. Not to find or make up a
phrase; no, he did not seek his ideas at the piano.
He went to the piano with his idea already composed,
and made the piano his sketch book
wherein he worked and reworked his subject,
steadily modelling his matter until it assumed the
shape he had in his mind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The names, dates of production, and principal
singers of his music-dramas have already been
given, together with some mention of his minor
compositions. An overture (“Faust”), three
marches, the “Siegfried Idyll,” built on themes
from the drama, a chorus, a male quartet, a funeral
march for Weber, five piano pieces, a few lovely
songs (two of them studies for “Tristan” music),
and nearly a dozen arrangements (among them
piano scores of “La Favorita,” and “L’Elisir
d’Amore,” pathetic mementoes of his starving days
in Paris), are the musical remains of this genius,
outside of his operatic works. The lyric stage was
the theatre of his career, and in the works prepared
for it he expended the force of his intellect, and
developed the ideas that proclaim him an epoch-maker.
Let us, therefore, turn our attention to the
Wagner theories, and their practical exposition in
the so-called “music of the future,” which has
become so intensely that of the present. What is
the Wagnerian theory of the opera? How does
it differ from that which preceded it? From what
germs did Wagner develop it? How has he embodied
it? These are questions which naturally
arise, and which demand answers.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may well be questioned whether Wagner had a
wholly comprehensive view of the essence and
results of his own artistic theories. There can be
no doubt that much of his work was the fruit of
what were in his own mind vaguer inspirations,
which he himself was unable to reduce to theoretical
formulæ. Therefore, while we may appeal to
his prose writings for evidence as to the sincerity
and direction of his intentions, we may readily
agree with the assertion of Mr. Hadow that “the
arguments which have established the Wagnerian
theory of opera are to be found not in ‘Opera and
Drama,’ but in the pages of ‘Tristan’ and ‘Parsifal.’”<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c009'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
It behooves us, therefore, to endeavor to
trace the development of the Wagnerian theory in
the mind of its inventor, and in order to do that
we must follow the plan of Mr. Krehbiel,<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c009'><sup>[9]</sup></a> and make
some inquiry into “the origin and nature of the
lyric drama.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the origin of the drama it is not the province
of this article to speak, but we may note that the
introduction of music into plays was a natural
movement. In Italy, where the opera was born,
choruses had been sung in plays as far back as
1350, but up to 1597 the ecclesiastical contrapuntal
style prevailed, and in that year the speeches of
a single personage, in a comedy of Orazzi Beechi’s,
were sung in five-part choruses of sombre canonic
form. The younger and more progressive minds in
Florence began to perceive the unsuitability of this
kind of music to the drama. In their search after
a new form they were guided by the revival of
interest in classic antiquity, known as the Renaissance;
and they set about reconstructing the
musical declamation of the Greeks. Their work
began with the production of “monodies,” or what
we should call to-day dramatic scenes for one voice.
Encouraged by their success in this direction, two
of these enthusiasts, Ottavio Rinuccini, poet, and
Jacopo Peri, musician, wrote a pastoral called
“Daphne.” This had all the elements of modern
opera, and its favorable reception at a private performance
led the two men to try again. This time
they wrote “Eurydice,” performed in public in
1600, and recognized as the first opera. The
pregnant achievement of Peri in these works was
the foundation of dramatic recitation. It was nothing
like the recitation of the Greeks, but it was a
new and noble art form, in which music strove to
imitate the nuances of speech without ceasing to
be music. “Soft and gentle speech he interpreted
by half-spoken, half-sung tones [modern <em>parlando</em>],
on a sustained instrumental bass; feelings of a
deeper emotional kind, by a melody with greater
intervals, and a lively tempo, the accompanying
instrumental harmonies changing more frequently.”<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c009'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
Peri’s theory, in short, was that recitative should
copy speech, and that his new art form, which
was christened <i><span lang="it">drama per musica</span></i>, should follow the
Greek tragedies as its models. Claudio Monteverde
advanced along the path indicated by Peri,
and furthermore began to make the orchestra a
potent factor in the musical exposition. But instrumental
music now exercised a baneful effect on
the opera, and in Cavalli’s “Giasone,” produced in
1649, we find the germs of the operatic aria, modelled
on the simple cyclical forms used by the
fathers of the sonata. Cavalli was opposed to
recitative, and furthered the cause of simple rhythmical
tune in opera. This new style was easy of comprehension
and popular. Alessandro Scarlatti took
it up and developed the aria so that it became the
central sun of the operatic system. The result was
inevitable. The person who could most beautifully
sing an aria captured the public heart; the singer
became the dominating power in opera, and the
composer was relegated to a secondary place.
From that time onward, the history of the artistic
development of opera is a series of contests between
the singer and the composer, with the
supremacy mostly on the side of the former. The
result of this was the imposition upon the opera of
a number of meaningless, artificial forms, in which a
musical purpose was manifest, but a dramatic design
wholly undiscernible. In Handel’s time this
artificiality had reached an absurd stage. The different
kinds of arias were labelled with extreme
minuteness in the matter of distinctions, and the
composer was required to produce just so many in
each opera and in each act. No vocalist might
have two consecutive arias, nor might two arias of
the same kind be sung in succession. But in the
second and third act the hero and the heroine each
had a claim to one grand scena followed by an <i><span lang="it">aria di
bravura</span></i>, the latter being designed simply to display
agility in ornamental passages. These laws were
afterwards modified, but down to the time of
Wagner’s supremacy an opera librettist was expected
to construct his book so that arias, duets,
trios, quartets, and ensemble numbers should be
found at places suitable to the composer. In short,
the nature and purpose of the opera had been lost
sight of; it was no longer <i><span lang="it">drama per musica</span></i>, but
<i><span lang="it">drama pro musica</span></i>,—a vastly different thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first resolute opposition to this style of thing
was made by Gluck, who had the same high regard
for the classics of antiquity as Peri and his confreres
had. Gluck’s theories and purposes are succinctly
expressed in his preface to “Alceste.” He
says:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“I endeavored to reduce music to its proper
function, that of seconding poetry by enforcing
the expression of the sentiment and the interest of
the situations without interrupting the action or
weakening it by superfluous ornament. My idea
was that the relation of music to poetry was much
the same as that of harmonious coloring and well-disposed
light and shade to an accurate drawing,
which animates the figure without altering the outlines....
My idea was that the overture ought to
indicate the subject and prepare the spectators for
the character of the piece they are about to see;
that the instruments ought to be introduced in proportion
to the degree of interest and passion in the
words; and that it was necessary above all to avoid
making too great a disparity between the recitative
and the air of a dialogue, so as not to break the
sense of a period or awkwardly interrupt the movement
and animation of a scene. I also thought
that my chief endeavor should be to attain a grand
simplicity; and consequently I have avoided making
a parade of difficulties at the cost of clearness.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These words make it plain that Gluck distinctly
perceived the fundamental principle of artistic truth
in opera,—that the music must be considered as a
means and not an end. He felt that the music
should be devoted, not to the exploitation of musical
possibilities, but to the faithful expression of the
emotions of the characters on the stage. His
reforms met with determined opposition, and some
of his contemporaries complained bitterly that they
were compelled to pay two florins “to be passionately
excited and thrilled instead of amused.”
But while Gluck made sweeping changes for the
better, he failed to reach the root of all evil. He
did not abolish from the operatic stage the set
forms, which made the musician the superior officer
of the poet, commanding the insertion of here a
solo and there a duet. The continuance of these
forms was conserved, too, by the splendid genius
of Mozart, who breathed into them a verisimilitude
which they had not before possessed. The glorious
boy had no reformer’s blood in his veins, but with
the instinct of spontaneous mastership he made the
spirit of his music vital, even though its form was
conventional. He founded no school, but he was
an excuse for the continuance of old traditions by
others less gifted than himself. So only twenty-six
years after Gluck’s death all Europe went mad
over “Ditanti palpiti,” and the name of Rossini
became the watchword of the lyric stage. The
opera was regarded as a parade ground for great
singers, and its music was expected to be cast in
the simplest melodic moulds, so that it could be
hummed, strummed, whistled, or indifferently sung
by the most poorly equipped amateurs. All conception
of the opera as a drama employing music
as a means of expression had been lost, and a man
who asserted that its model had originally been and
ought always to be the Greek play would have
been stared at as one unsound of mind. That
there were a few who were ready to raise from
triviality so splendid an art form was proved by
the gathering of warm and faithful adherents
around the banner of reform raised by Wagner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Like most young artists he began his career
by imitating the work of the acknowledged masters
of his time. As we have already seen, he had no
novel ideas in the composition of “Die Feen.” He
simply tried to imitate Beethoven, Weber, and
Marschner. At this time the music of Beethoven
was his ideal. Heinrich Dorn has testified that no
young musician could possibly have known the
works of the immortal symphonist more thoroughly.
But Wagner soon saw very clearly that it was not in
his power to adopt the Beethovenian style to the lyric
drama. For models for his second work, therefore,
he chose Auber and Bellini. The former’s “Massaniello”
had opened his eyes to the value of action
with brisk music to accompany it. The latter’s
“Montecchi e Capuletti,” or rather Schroeder-Devrient’s
inspiring performance of Romeo, had
given him suggestions as to the dramatic possibilities
of vocal melody. In his second work, “Das Liebesverbot,”
he tried to effect a combination of the
styles of these two masters. It must not be supposed
that he was searching merely for popular
applause. He was intensely in earnest even at
that stage of his career, and his aim was to produce
real art. He did not yet perceive the utter falsity
of the prevailing system, though he was honest in
his endeavor to make it tell the truth. In his autobiographical
sketch he records thus the ideas raised
in his mind by the Bellini performance:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“I grew doubtful as to the choice of the proper
means to bring about a great success; far though
I was from attaching to Bellini a signal merit, yet
the subject to which his music was set seemed to
me to be more propitious and better calculated to
spread the warm glow of life than the painstaking
pedantry with which we Germans, as a rule, brought
naught but laborious make-believe to market. The
flabby lack of character of our modern Italians,
equally with the frivolous levity of the latest Frenchmen,
appeared to me to challenge the earnest, conscientious
German to master the happily chosen
and happily exploited means of his rivals, in order
then to outstrip them in the production of genuine
works of art.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Artistic sincerity of purpose, then, was already
the man’s moving force. The immediate impulse
which led him to take the first step in the development
of his own individuality was the conviction
that the provincial public of the smaller German
cities was incapable of forming a judgment as to
the value of a new work. He, therefore, began
“Rienzi” with a determination to write an opera
which could be produced only at a grand opera
house, and he decided not to trouble his mind
as to what theatre of that rank would give him
an entrance. He says:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“I allowed naught to influence me except the
single purpose to answer to my subject. I set myself
no model, but gave myself entirely to the feeling
which now consumed me, the feeling that I had
already so far progressed that I might claim something
significant from the development of my artistic
powers, and expect some not insignificant result.
The very notion of being consciously weak or trivial,
even in a single bar, was appalling to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wagner never wrote words fraught with greater
significance. To sit down with a determination to
not be weak or trivial in a single bar, and to be
always faithful to his subject, and yet to construct
his opera on the prevailing models, was for a man of
Wagner’s intellectual power and artistic temperament
to discover the radical defects of the opera
of his day. He could not follow his models without
being consciously weak or trivial at times. An
examination of the libretto of “Rienzi” shows that
while there is carelessness in the poetry, the
dramatic construction is excellent. No better opera
libretto dates from the time of its production. But
it was constructed, as Wagner confessed, to enable
him “to display the principal forms of grand opera,
such as introductions, finales, choruses, arias, duets,
trios, etc., with all possible splendor.” Consequently,
while there is much in the music that is
noble, dignified, and characteristic of Wagner,
there is more that is weak, trivial, and imitative.
“Rienzi” is a very good opera of the old sort, and
the dramatic force of its book, together with the
excellence of much of its music, has kept it favorably
before the public. But it lacks artistic coherency,
because its fundamental principle is false;
and Wagner knew it before he had completed the
work. The writer of this article does not believe
that this master, as some of his warmest admirers
have asserted, began “Rienzi” with a deliberate
intention of catering to a depraved public taste for
the sake of success. Wagner earnestly craved success
at that time; he needed money, and he yearned
for public recognition; but his own words show
that he was deluded into supposing that artistic
work could be done on the lines of the popular
opera of his day. It required the writing of
“Rienzi” to bring to his mind the convictions,
which were put to test in “The Flying Dutchman,”
after he had abandoned the hope of pecuniary
success. This is not the place for a discussion of the
relative importance of objectivity and subjectivity in
art; but it is certain that “The Flying Dutchman”
is the result of an overwhelming desire for self-expression.
Wagner at this period of his mental
growth could have cried with Omar Khayyám:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I sent my soul through the Invisible,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Some letter of that after-life to spell;</div>
      <div class='line'>And by and by my soul returned to me,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And answered, ‘I myself am heaven and hell.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Overcome by his first real draught of the bitterness
of life, he found that his emotional moods
were clamoring for expression. With the splendid
egotism of genius, he discerned the sorrow of a
world in his own suffering. To dramatize this
became his burning desire. The legend of the
Ahasuerus of the sea, cursed by his own determination
to overcome obstacles, opposed by all the
powers of nature, seemed to Wagner the embodiment
of his own experience; and he turned to the
work of making an opera out of it, with no purpose
except a complete and convincing expression of
the prevailing moods of his own soul. And it was
thus that he came upon the fundamental principles
of the theory which set the musical world agog and
raised up lions in his path. The first conviction
that came to him was that of the superiority of a
legendary over a historical story. He subsequently
wrote of it thus:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“In this and all succeeding plans, I turned for
the selection of my material once for all from the
domain of history to that of legend.... All
the details necessary for the description and presentation
of the conventionally historic, which a
fixed and limited historical epoch demands in
order to make the action clearly intelligible,—and
which are therefore carried out so circumstantially
by the historical novelists and dramatists of to-day,—could
be here omitted. And by this means the
poetry, and especially the music, were freed from
the necessity of a method of treatment entirely
foreign to them, and particularly impossible as far
as music was concerned. The legend, in whatever
nation or age it may be placed, has the advantage
that it comprehends only the purely <em>human</em> portion
of this age or nation, and presents this portion in a
form peculiar to it, thoroughly concentrated, and
therefore easily intelligible.... This legendary
character gives a great advantage to the poetic
arrangement of the subject for the reason already
mentioned, that, while the simple process of the
action—easily comprehensible as far as its outward
relations are concerned—renders unnecessary any
painstaking for the purpose of explanation of the
course of the story, the greatest possible portion
of the poem can be devoted to the portrayal of the
inner <em>motives</em> of the action,—those inmost motives
of the soul, which, indeed, the action points out to
us as necessary, through the fact that we ourselves
feel in our hearts a sympathy with them.”<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c009'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The second conviction that came to him was
that of the folly of writing music at random, instead
of clinging to the musical investiture
of a mood once formed.
This led him to the abandonment
of the set forms of the
established opera, and to the
adoption of his own plan of making
the music and poetry an artistic
unit. His words in regard to
this matter are worth quoting:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The plastic unity and simplicity
of the mythical subjects
allowed of the concentration of
the action on certain important
and decisive points, and thus
enabled me to rest on fewer
scenes with a perseverance sufficient
to expound the motive to
its ultimate dramatic consequences.
The nature of the subject,
therefore, could not induce me,
in sketching my scenes, to consider
in advance their adaptability
to any particular musical
form, the kind of musical treatment
being in each case necessitated
by these scenes themselves.
It could, therefore, not
enter my mind to engraft on
this my musical form, growing,
as it did, out of the nature of
the scenes, the traditional forms
of operatic music, which could
not but have marred and interrupted
its organic development.
I therefore never thought of
contemplating on principle and
as a deliberate reformer the
destruction of the aria, duet, and other operatic
forms; but the dropping of those forms followed
consistently from the nature of my subjects.”<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c009'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p>RICHARD WAGNER.<br>  <br>  From a photograph from life taken in Vienna about 1875 by Fr. Luckhardt.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He found the germs of his future musical system
in the ballad of Senta. In this the legend of the
unhappy Hollander is told, and in its musical investiture
Wagner invented two melodic themes with
distinct purposes. The first was intended to illustrate
the personality of the Dutchman as an embodiment
of yearning for rest. The second was
designed to represent the redeeming principle, the
<i><span lang="de">ewig weibliche</span></i>, the eternal womanhood, which became
the ruling ethical feature of all Wagner’s lyric
works. Here are the two themes:—</p>

<div class='x-ebookmaker-drop'>

</div>

</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/music120.jpg' alt='[Music]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>These two themes being designed to represent
certain ideas, it was inevitable that the composer
should use them whenever those ideas recurred.
As he tells us himself in the essay quoted above:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“I had merely to develop, according to their
respective tendencies, the various thematic germs
comprised in the ballad, to have, as a matter of
course, the principal mental moods in definite
thematic shapes before me. When a mental mood
returned, its thematic expression also, as a matter
of course, was repeated, since it would have been
arbitrary and capricious to have sought another
<em>motive</em> so long as the object was an intelligible representation
of the subject, and not a conglomeration
of operatic pieces.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We have now traced the origin of the three
elementary principles out of which Wagner elaborated
his system: First, the dramatic advantage of
mythological or legendary subjects; second, the “intelligible
representation of the subject”; and third,
the use of the representative theme, “typical phrase”
or <em>leit motif</em>. In “The Flying Dutchman” we find
his system in its embryonic state, but the perfected
system, as displayed in “Tristan” and “The Ring,”
is only a logical outcome of these first thoughts,
intensified, as it were, by his realization that the
whole thing was simply a modernization of the
practice of the greatest Greek dramatists. This realization
caused him to question whether, through
the medium of an art founded on his theories, the
modern stage could not acquire a national importance
and influence, such as the Greek theatre
possessed. It will undoubtedly be easier for the
reader now to take a comprehensive survey of the
full-blown Wagnerian system than to try to follow its
growth through the transitional stage of “Tannhäuser”
and “Lohengrin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wagner’s first law, as formulated succinctly by
W. F. Apthorp in a magazine article, is: “That the
text—what in old-fashioned dialect was called the
libretto—once written by the poet, all other persons
who have to do with the work—composer,
stage architect, scene painter, costumer, stage manager,
conductor, and singing actors—should aim at
one thing only: the most exact, perfect, and
lifelike embodiment of the poet’s thought.” So far
as the composition of the music is concerned, this
is precisely what Peri and Gluck believed. But
Peri had to invent dramatic recitative; and standing,
as it were, just on the hither side of chaos, he
could not be expected to produce at once a
perfected art world. The materials of operatic art
were in process of making; the first builder had
not the wherewith to rear a musical cathedral.
Gluck erred in preserving the cut-and-dried operatic
forms which made it impossible for him to
achieve his sincere design,—“to reduce music to
its proper function, that of seconding poetry by
enforcing the expression of the sentiment and the
interest of the situations, without interrupting
the action, or weakening it by superfluous ornament.”
It was comparatively easy to get rid of
the “superfluous ornament”; but the methodical
distribution of the old forms was found to interrupt
the action. It remained for Wagner to see that
these forms were unavailable for the composer who
aimed at the complete embodiment of the poet’s
thought; and it remained for him also to discern
that the ideal lyric drama demanded an ideal
harmony among its various elements. In other
words, the perfected Wagnerian theory of the lyric
drama contemplates the compact union of poetry,
music, painting, action, and all the other factors of
dramatic illusion on a basis of common interdependence,
so binding that it shall be impossible to say
that one is more important than another, so perfect
that no separation can be made without a loss of
vital force.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wagner discerned in the theatre the source of
such art influence as reached the great mass of the
people. Looking upon its managers and its public
as they actually appeared before his eyes, he saw
the theatre in the hands of those to whom art was
nothing and gain everything, while the public, jaded
and sated, ceaselessly clamored for new sensations.
Continued attempts of the money-seeking managers
to satisfy this public demand, which was in its
very nature insatiable, had led to a condition of
opera in which the music had no organic connection
with the text, the pageantry and ballets no
logical relation to the pictorial ensemble. Turning
his gaze backward to the home of true art, Greece,
he saw a drama in which poetry, action, and music
were indissolubly united.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thus,” he says, “we can by no means recognize
in our theatrical art the genuine drama; that
one, indivisible, supreme creation of the mind of
man. Our theatre merely offers the convenient
<em>locale</em> for the tempting exhibition of the heterogeneous
wares of art manufacture. How incapable is
our stage to gather up each branch of art in its
highest and most perfect expression—the drama—it
shows at once in its division into the two
opposing classes, play and opera; whereby the
idealizing influence of music is forbidden to the
play, and the opera is forestalled of the living
heart and lofty purpose of actual drama. Thus on
the one hand the spoken play can never, with but
few exceptions, lift itself up to the ideal flight of
poetry; but, for very reason of the poverty of its
means of utterance,—to say nothing of the demoralizing
influence of our public life,—must fall
from height to depth, from the warm atmosphere
of passion to the cold element of intrigue. On
the other hand the opera becomes a chaos of
sensuous impressions jostling one another without
rhyme or reason, from which each one may choose
at will what pleases best his fancy; here the alluring
movements of a dancer, there the <em>bravura</em>
passage of a singer; here the dazzling effect of a
triumph of the scene painter, there the astounding
efforts of a Vulcan of the orchestra....”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The public art of the Greeks, which reached
its zenith in their tragedy, was the expression of
the deepest and the noblest principles of the people’s
consciousness; with <em>us</em> the deepest and
noblest principle of man’s consciousness is the
direct opposite of this, namely, the denunciation
of our public art. To the Greeks the production
of a tragedy was a religious festival, where the
gods bestirred themselves upon the stage and
bestowed on men their wisdom; <em>our</em> evil conscience
has so lowered the theatre in public estimation
that it is the duty of the police to prevent
the stage from meddling in the slightest with
religion; a circumstance as characteristic of our
religion as of our art. Within the ample boundaries
of the Grecian amphitheatre the whole
populace was wont to witness the performances: in
our superior theatres loll only the affluent classes.
The Greeks sought the instruments of their art in
the products of the highest associate culture: we
seek ours in the deepest social barbarism. The
education of the Greek, from his earliest youth,
made himself the subject of his own artistic treatment
and artistic enjoyment in body as in spirit:
our foolish education, fashioned for the most part
to fit us merely for future industrial gain, gives us a
ridiculous, and withal arrogant, satisfaction with
our own unfitness for art, and forces us to seek the
subjects of any kind of artistic amusement outside
ourselves.”<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c009'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Making due allowance for the heated utterance
of one to whom the questions at issue had such
grave personal importance as to prevent judicial
calmness of speech, we cannot fail to perceive that
Wagner had penetrated to the essence of the difference
between the stage of Greece and that of
Europe in his day. The compact union of the arts
tributary to the stage had been at once the outcome
and the embodiment of that intensely national art-feeling
which he contrasted so bitterly with the
modern European lack of art-feeling, as he saw it.
With the downfall of the Athenian, state tragedy
fell also, and “art became less and less the expression
of the public conscience.” In Wagner’s
mind this downfall resembled that of the tower of
Babel, with its subsequent dispersion of the tribes.
The dramatic union of arts was dismembered.
Poetry, painting, music, rhetoric, all separated,
and each went its own way in pursuit of its own
ends. No one who has reviewed the history of
the fine arts in the Middle Ages can fail to have
observed how blindly they seemed to grope their
way toward the gates of truth until the guiding
light of the Renaissance, with its new revelation
of the classic antiquity, was turned upon Italy by
the scholars driven out of Constantinople by the
fall of Rome’s Eastern Empire. Wagner has reviewed
the dissevered condition of the arts and
their employment as means, and not ends, in a few
terse sentences in the essay already quoted; and
then he says:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Each one of these dissevered arts, nursed and
luxuriously tended for the entertainment of the
rich, has filled the world to overflowing with its
products; in each great minds have brought forth
marvels; but the one true art has not been born
again, either in or since the Renaissance. The
perfect art work, the great united utterance of a
free and lovely public life, the <em>Drama</em>, <em>Tragedy</em>,—howsoever
great the poets who have here and there
indited tragedies,—is not yet born again; for the
reason that it cannot be reborn, but must be born
anew.”<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c009'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This, then, was the herculean task which this
self-appointed reformer of the drama set before
him; to demonstrate that the modern theatre had
the power to bring itself into the same relation to
the noblest ideal life of man as the Greek theatre
had; and in order that this might be achieved it
was necessary, in his opinion, to return to that
union of the arts, which has been mentioned so
often. He believed that in his day each art had
done all that it could do without the aid of the
other. Music unaided could go no further than it
had in Beethoven’s symphonies. Indeed, even the
mighty Ludwig had called in the help of poetry to
complete his Ninth Symphony. Poetry could rise
no higher than the wings of Shakespeare, Goethe,
and Schiller had carried her. At this point, then,
must come that fusion of the arts, in which each
would sacrifice something of its egotism for the sake
of the splendid whole; and that whole would be
the art work of the future, the drama for the people.
In order fairly to appreciate Wagner’s purposes
we must pause here to inquire, what people?
The answer to this question lies at the root of the
whole controversy which has arisen about Wagner’s
works; or perhaps it would be more accurate to
say that it is the neglect to make and properly
answer this inquiry which leads insufficiently informed
persons to look upon Wagner as a rabid
iconoclast. The people for whom he sought to
rear anew the ideal drama was the German people.
As Mr. Krehbiel has expressed it: “Wagner
believes that the elements of the lyric drama
ought to be adapted to the peculiarities, and to
encourage the national feeling of the people for
whom it is created.... One of Wagner’s
most persistent aims was to reanimate a national
art spirit in Germany. The rest of the world he
omitted from his consideration.”<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c009'><sup>[15]</sup></a> This was an
inevitable result of his conviction, acquired from
study of the Greek stage, that the ideal drama
should be national in spirit.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already seen that, according to his
ideas, the union of poetry, painting, music, and
action in the “art work of the future” could be
effected only by some sacrifice on the part of each
art. Wagner plainly saw, as we must see, that the
special feature which must yield to the necessary
modification was <em>form</em>, or, more strictly speaking,
<em>formality</em>. It was not form in the abstract that
must be sacrificed, but forms in the concrete,—forms
which owed their preservation to tradition,
and not to any intrinsic worth or imperative demand
of art. To preserve the old-fashioned
operatic forms would have been to continue the
dominance of music in the drama; for the poet
would still have been a mere librettist, bound to
provide for the aria, the duet, and the finale. To
introduce a distinctive kind of versification, such as
the Alexandrine, or the Spencerian stanza, would
have made poetry the controlling element. The
first problem set before Wagner, then, was to find
subjects which would admit of the utmost freedom
and unconventionality of treatment. Already in
the embryonic state of his theories, the myth had
forced itself upon his mind as the necessary kind of
subject; and in the final working out of those
theories to their end, the myth stood the test,
with this important corollary, that it must be a
myth embodying one of the great elementary
thoughts of mankind. Turn which way he would,
he found support for his belief. Did the legendary
beings of the Greek stage lack the humanity and
the ethical conditions necessary for great tragedy?
On the contrary, as Mr. Stedman has put it:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“The high gods of Æschylus and Sophocles for
the most part sit above the thunder: but the human
element pervades these dramas; the legendary
demigods, heroes, <em>gentes</em>, that serve as the personages,—Hermes,
Herakles, the houses of Theseus,
Atreus, Jason,—all are types of human kind, repeating
the Hebraic argument of transmitted tendency,
virtue and crime, and the results of crime especially
from generation to generation.”<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c009'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>And when Wagner turned from the Greek
drama to the philosophy of his beloved Schopenhauer,
he found the same convictions forced
upon him again by his teacher’s art theory.
This theory is propounded in Book III. of “The
World as Will and Representation.” The
writer begs leave to quote a summary of it which
he has made in a study of “Tristan”:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Divested of its robes of metaphysical terminology,
it is this: When the human mind rises
from the study of the location, period, causes, and
tendencies of things to the undivided examination of
their essence, and when, further, this consideration
takes place, not through the medium of abstract
thought, but in calm contemplation of the immediately
present natural object, then the mind is brought
face to face with eternal ideas. Art, the work of
genius, repeats these eternal ideas, which are the
essential and permanent things in the phenomena of
the world. In other words, art endeavors to exhibit
to us the eternal essence of things by means of prototypes.”<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c009'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p>RICHARD WAGNER.<br>  <br>  From a family group, photographed shortly before his death.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Of course, Wagner could not find prototypes
embodying “the eternal essence of things” in the
small and shallow stories to which the librettists of
the majority of the popular operas of his time had
turned. He must seek for material which had its
roots in the great heart of the people; which was
not the fancy of a single mind, but the formulation
of a people’s ideal. To the myth, then, he turned,
impelled by his own reasoning, by the arguments of
divine philosophy, as he read them, and by the
equally eloquent example of revered antiquity.
And, indeed, we must all admit that the true myth is
the individualization of an abstract ideal, and if we
accept the Wagnerian theory, that abstract ideal
should be embodied in the personages of the
drama, we must also accept the myth. Even if
we refuse to believe that ideals, or even types,
should be the actors in a drama, we shall probably
have no hesitation in admitting that for <em>musical
exposition</em> only the broad, elementary emotions of
humanity are well suited; and these are always found
most freely and powerfully displayed in the great
world-thoughts of mythology. Thus Wagner’s
Tristan and his Isolde are plainly intended to
be embodiments of the elementary man and
woman, standing in primeval barbarian grandeur at
gaze one upon the other, and overwhelmed by the
tragic power of mastering passion. The history of
the Tristan legend, which has found its way in
different forms into the literature of several languages,
is proof that the world has so regarded it.
For six hundred years poets have accepted Tristan
and Isolde as the most convincing representatives of
the mastery and the misery of love. In this they
stand sharply distinguished from the hero and
heroine of Wagner’s comedy, “Die Meistersinger.”
Walther and Eva, moving in a story whose design is
to touch the manners of a time with the gentle
reproof of satire, are not the embodiments of
elementary thoughts, but are circumscribed by the
manifest environments of locality and period. But
Tristan and Siegfried are the unfettered, unconventioned
man of all times and places; while Brünnhilde
and Isolde are visible forms of the highest
of Wagner’s ideals, the eternal womanhood. It
is a significant fact that this master, in the first
works produced after he had abandoned the old style,—“The
Flying Dutchman,” and “Tannhäuser,”—dealt
with these eternal types, while in “Lohengrin”
he confined himself within comparatively narrower
limits, returning to his first position when he had
fully formulated the theories whose promptings rose
within him as only vague, artistic instincts in his early
works. And having cleared his theories from all
doubts in his own mind, he emphasized the humanity
of his mythical characters by some of his finest
touches.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The northern Scalds created tremendous myths.
The spirit of their poems was colossal. Passions
and sweetness stood side by side and were delineated
with master strokes. Lofty sentiment and
heroic deed were darkened by unspeakable crime
and black tragedy. The German bards denuded
these old poems of their glory and made their personages
small. The heroes and heroines of the
Sagas were enormous unrealities; those of the
Nibelungen Lied were almost pretentious nonentities.
Wagner seized upon every trait of character
and every incident that was most human and made
masterly use of it. It is the ease with which we
recognize in the people of ‘Der Ring des Nibelungen’
primeval human types that makes us receptive
of their influence and movable by their greatness.”<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c009'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Having found his people, the next object of the
poet-composer was to select a flexible and yielding
form for their utterance. He must find a form of
verse which could be organically united with music,
which would suggest a rhythmical basis for the
melody, yet not control its construction. The
various forms of modern versification, founded on
the rhetorical accent of words, offered him no advantages,
but, on the contrary, placed difficulties in
the path of his movement. Rhyme, for instance,
has no value whatever for the composer, unless he
constructs the phrases and sections of his melody
with the same number of feet and the same metrical
pauses as are found in the verse; and this
method, of course, gives the mere formalism of the
poetry the government of the process of composition.
On the other hand, blank verse is bound to
find the same treatment in music as prose does.
Wagner, therefore, turned to the metrical basis of
all Teutonic poetry, namely, the alliterative line, as
it is found in the “Eddas.” The peculiarity of this
line is the emphasizing of its rhythm by the employment
of similar sounds at the beginning of the accented
syllables. A fair specimen of it is the opening
of Siegmund’s love song in “Die Walküre”:—</p>

<p>RICHARD WAGNER AT BAYREUTH.—By G. Papperitz.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A clause such as “Winterstürme wichen dem Wonnemond”
readily suggests to the ear the position of
musical accents which will be identical with those of
the verse, but which leave the composer wholly free
in his melodic treatment of <em>lines</em>. A single glance
will demonstrate to the reader that the above words
can be placed in lines three or four times as long
without making the slightest change in the rhythmical
effect produced by the alliteration.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now come to Wagner’s musical method, the
nature of which has already been briefly indicated
in the account of the birth in his mind of his new
ideas. In his search after a modern substitute for
the sustained intonation of the Greek drama, he had
before him for study the dramatic recitative of Peri
and the dramatic <em>arioso</em> style of Gluck. The
former was wholly unavailable. Years of use had
fastened upon it a collection of traditional phrases,
familiar to the ear of every one who goes often to
hear opera or oratorio. These traditional phrases,
hopelessly inflexible, made dramatic recitative a thing
of conventionalities, and unconventionality was the
only hope for Wagner’s system. The Gluck <em>arioso</em>
style was equally unsuited to his purpose, because, as
we have been obliged to note before, it preserved the
formalities of the old-fashioned opera,—those very
formalities which Wagner felt that he must abandon
if he would secure his compact union of the arts
tributary to the stage. He needed a style of composition
which would permit the music to flow
freely from the words and which would impose no
obligation on the composer to repeat certain words
or lines in order that certain passages of music
might be rounded out to a pretty close as in the
old-fashioned aria. He was in search of lyric
expressiveness freed from lyric conventionality.
He therefore decided that each act of any one of
his music-dramas must consist of one unbroken
stream of melody. In other words, as long as there
were persons or scenes before the audience, there
must be a musical exposition of their moods, and
that exposition must be unbroken and apparently
unartificial in form, just as a train of moods is.</p>

<p class='c007'>But to make the actors sing without cessation
would fatigue both them and the audience; and,
moreover, it would be untrue to nature, since men
and women do not frame every thought and
emotion in words. Hence Wagner conceived the
idea of allotting the voicing of the ceaseless melody
to the orchestra, while the personages of the drama
should utter their words in a form of lyric recitative
based on the broader principles of Peri, as
expressed in his preface to “Eurydice,” but
freed from acquired conventions and modified
according to the promptings of Wagner’s own
musical genius. Naturally, then, the question
arose in the composer’s mind, “What form is
my melody to have?” For he knew as well as
Schumann did that music demands first of all
things form. Now, the basis of musical form is
the repetition of melodic phrases. There is no
form, and therefore no coherence, no sense, in
music consisting of disjointed phrases, each of
which is heard once and never again. Yet to
repeat them in any of the old-fashioned ways
would have been to load himself down with some
one of the set forms which he was trying to escape.
Consequently this formidable problem was before
him: How was he to make his endless melody
intelligible to the auditor, to give it a palpable
significance, to convey through it to the hearer
the emotional moods of his personages, and yet
impose upon it musical form, based upon repetition,
but free from the artificiality of the older
formulas? He found the solution in the suggestion
which had come to him when he invented the
two principal themes of Senta’s ballad in “The
Flying Dutchman.” The solution of the problem
was the perfection of this system of representative
themes, each designed to stand for a particular
person, thought, mood, or action, and to be
repeated by the orchestra or vocalist whenever
its subject had significance, though not necessarily
presence, in the scene before the audience.</p>

<p class='c007'>How are these representative themes obtained?
Does Wagner construct a melody arbitrarily according
to his fancy, and label it the “Siegfried”
motive, the “Brünnhilde” motive? A moment’s
reflection will suffice to convince the reader that
such a system would be worse than puerile. It
would not be in any sense as good as the method
of Donizetti, who could at least give a pathetic
color to the aria of his moribund tenor. Wagner’s
high purpose was to make an indissoluble organic
union between the poem and the music, and this
purpose forbade all arbitrary or haphazard procedure
in the construction of a <em>leit motif</em>. Music
has a certain power of emotional expression;
therefore Wagner’s endeavor was to invent
themes representative of characteristic traits or
emotional tendencies of his personages. In some
cases when he required a musical representation
of an inanimate object, he invented a theme which
would suggest the object by suggesting emotions
associated with it. Another class of themes is
descriptive of externals, and belongs to what has
been well called scenic music. The last class is
the smallest, for, as a rule, Wagner’s scenic music
serves its purpose but once. When it is intended for
only one hearing, it is simply descriptive music,
freely composed. When intended for more than
one hearing, it has a deeper significance. Let us
make a closer examination of the master’s processes
in the construction of these leading motives,
and that we may be logical, let us begin with the
lowest order, the scenic.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The central and the most picturesque character
of “The Rheingold” is Loge, the god of fire. In
this prologue of the tetralogy he appears as the evil
counsellor of Wotan, and while his character is
indicated in many striking ways, his entrance is
heralded by a purely scenic bit of music known as
the magic fire music.</p>

<div class='x-ebookmaker-drop'>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/music133.jpg' alt='[Music]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This music is intended solely to represent the
flickering, ascending fire. It reappears with most
picturesque effect at the close of “Die Walküre,”
when Wotan, having put Brünnhilde to sleep upon
her rock, summons the fire from the earth to keep
her couch inaccessible to all save the yet unborn
hero who shall know no fear.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c009'><sup>[19]</sup></a> Examples of the
free descriptive or scenic music, composed without
leading motives, may be found in “Tristan” (the
sailors’ music, and the shepherd’s piping), in
“Siegfried” (the familiar “Waldweben”), and in
“Parsifal” (the dance of the flower maidens).
Of the class of music a step higher in respect of
significance,—that in which an inanimate object is
represented by an appeal to the emotions associated
with it,—the most brilliant example is the sword
motive. The sword of Siegmund, which is to be
welded anew by Siegfried and used by him in wresting
the Rhine treasure from the grasp of the giant
Fafner, is one of the most potent agents in the
advancement of the action of the tetralogy. It is
always indicated musically by this bold, martial
theme, whose brilliant challenge rings with the pride
of combat:—</p>

<div class='x-ebookmaker-drop'>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/music134a.jpg' alt='[Music]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is a notable evidence of the depth of Wagner’s
artistic purpose that he first uses this motive in
“Das Rheingold,” before the sword has been
fashioned, when only the idea of creating the race
of Siegmund has dawned in Wotan’s mind. Another
motive of this kind is that which represents the
tarn helm, the magic cap whose possessor can make
himself invisible or change his appearance. The
motive is so uncertain in its tonality—a quality
obtained by the use of the empty fifth—that it adequately
depicts the mysterious nature of the tarn
helm.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/music134b.jpg' alt='[Music]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But the most beautiful and significant development
of this remarkable musical system is to be
found in the construction of those motives which
are designed to illustrate the emotions and dramatic
principles of the plays. Of these there are some
which have also a scenic aspect and at first will
seem to the new hearer of Wagner’s works to belong
wholly to the external class. The most easily
comprehended is that commonly described as the
smithy motive. The Nibelungs were dwarfs, dwellers
in the hollows of the earth, and workers in
precious metals. They were a crushed, tyrannized
race, and after one of their number, Alberich, had
obtained power over the worldly possession of a
ring of Rhine gold, they became the most abject of
slaves. Two things appeal to us in the contemplation
of this race: first, ceaseless labor at the
smithy; second, the bitterness of spirit caused by
the drudgery. Wagner invented for the theme
representative of this race the smithy motive,
founded on a rhythm imitative of the beating of
hammers.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems at first as if this theme could picture for
us only that beating. But in the second act Alberich’s
brother, Mime, who has been plotting to get
the Rhine treasure for himself, is slain by Siegfried.
Then Alberich, who is concealed in the forest and
witnesses the scene, laughs aloud in bitter scorn
of his fallen foe; and his laugh consists of that
Nibelung theme sung fortissimo. Then we perceive
that the theme fully embodies both of
the characteristics of the dwarfs, of which the
second is the product of the first. To rise a step
higher, in the first act of “Die Walküre,” when
Siegmund and Sieglinde, the only living members
of the race of Volsungs, are gazing into one another’s
eyes and learning to sympathize with one
another’s sorrows, the orchestra, always revealing
to us the most secret feelings of the actors, plays
this passage:—</p>

<div class='x-ebookmaker-drop'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>[<a href="music/136b.mp3">Listen</a>] [<a href="music/136b.mxl">MusicXML</a>]</div>

</div>

</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/music136b.jpg' alt='[Music]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The bass phrase is the motive of the Volsung
race, and its melancholy character is intended
to remind us that this is<a id='t562'></a> a race of tragic heroes
whose heritage is woe. The treble phrase is the
motive of sympathy. It is, therefore, written in
thirds, the closest and most elementary of those
harmonic agreements called consonances, and it
is, in melody as well as harmony, expressive of
sympathy. In the second act of the drama of
“Siegfried,” when the young hero lies under the
tree in the forest and wonders what manner of
being his mother was, the orchestra reminds us
that he is a Volsung by intoning the motive in this
form:—</p>

<div class='x-ebookmaker-drop'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>[<a href="music/136c.mp3">Listen</a>] [<a href="music/136c.mxl">MusicXML</a>]</div>

</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/music136c.jpg' alt='[Music]' class='ig001'>
</div>
<p class='c007'>And again when Siegfried in “Die Götterdämmerung”
has sobbed forth his last words and lies
dead among Gunther’s appalled vassals, the basses
of the orchestra once more wail out this sad motive,
accentuated by muttered beats of the kettle drums.
Thus we see that this motive is always heard when
the two thoughts—Volsung race and its woe—are
especially significant in the drama. We learn that
it refers to these two things by the text with which
it is associated, and we then find that it intensifies
for us the feeling of that text.</p>

<p>UNFINISHED BUST OF RICHARD WAGNER.<br>  <br>  Last work of Lorenz Gedon, in possession of Friedrich Schön, of Worms.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The association with the text is, of course, the
key-note of Wagner’s <em>leit motif</em> system. There
can be no successful refutation of the assertion that
a few of the leading themes of the Bayreuth music-dramas
are arbitrary in their formation. There are
themes which are intended to represent purely intellectual
processes, and this is something that music
cannot do. But we need never be at a loss as to
Wagner’s intent. No lecturer nor handbook is
necessary as a guide through the music of these
works when the hearer has once grasped the idea
that every <em>leit motif</em> is associated with the words or
the acts which explain its design, and this, too,
almost invariably on its first appearance. All that
the hearer needs to know is the text. It was not a
part of Wagner’s theory that his listeners should commit
to memory a string of titles of motives, such as
the “Love Renunciation Motive,” the “Hero Idea,”
the “Love Thrills,” the “Decree of Fate.” Many
of these titles have been invented by the handbook
makers, who, in their eagerness to explain Wagner
to the world, have done much to persuade the world
that he is incomprehensible. The student of
Wagner needs no translation of the music, except
the text. Wagner did not believe, as many have
asserted, that music was capable of definite expression
as words are. On the contrary, in his prose
works, he again and again declared that music was
incapable of telling a story, that it demanded the
assistance of text, and that the two must be joined
in such close wedlock that they would operate upon
the mind and emotions of the hearer as a single
indivisible force. Therefore the student of these
works needs only to make himself master of the
poems, and then to note carefully the music that
accompanies every sentiment or deed. In the
Nibelung tetralogy, the music of “Rheingold” is
the foundation of all that follows, and it must be
known first. As each new motive appears in that
work, it is explained. Two or three illustrations
will suffice. In the first scene, the three Rhine-maidens
sing this:—</p>

<div class='x-ebookmaker-drop'>

  <div class='nf-center'>

<div class='ic005'>
<p>Rhinegold, Rhinegold, lustrous delight,<br>  Thou laughest in radiance rare.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When Siegfried, having slain the dragon, comes
out of the cave, that music is heard in the orchestra.
Does any one need a handbook to tell him that it
refers to the hero’s being now the master of the
Rhine gold? Again, after telling Alberich that he
who can make a ring out of the Rhine gold will
have unlimited power, one of the girls sings this:—</p>

<div class='x-ebookmaker-drop'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>[<a href="music/139b.mp3">Listen</a>] [<a href="music/139b.mxl">MusicXML</a>]</div>

</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/music139b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic005'>
<p>But he who passion’s power forswears,<br>  And from delights of love forbears,<br>  But he the magic commandeth the prize to mould to a ring.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Here the text fully identifies the music as the motive
of renunciation, and as such we recognize this
melody when Wotan in the last scene of “Die
Walküre” parts from his best beloved daughter,
Brünnhilde. This first identification of a theme
enables the composer to attain some of his finest
effects, for he makes some motives have an air of
prophecy. For instance, two motives are especially
connected with Siegfried, and one of them
refers to his being a great hero. This motive is
first heard in the last scene of “Die Walküre”
before Siegfried is born, and before Brünnhilde
knows that he is to be her lover. Yet it is Brünnhilde
who voices it in foretelling his birth to
Sieglinde:—</p>

<div class='x-ebookmaker-drop'>

<div class='ic005'>
<p>The highest hero of worlds hid’st thou,<br>  O wife, in sheltering shrine.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Thenceforward we know that melody to be the
theme of Siegfried, the hero. Immediately following
this is introduced a theme which appears
again in the full voicing of the orchestra after
Brünnhilde has restored the Rhine gold to its rightful
owners and immolated herself on Siegfried’s
funeral pyre at the end of the last drama of the
series. If we wonder at its meaning there, we refer
to its first appearance in “Die Walküre,” and
find that Sieglinde utters it as a proclamation of
the divine womanhood of Brünnhilde:—</p>

<div class='ic005'>
<p>Oh, marvelous sayings,<br>  Maiden divine.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Another example will show how a representative
theme may be modified, according to the development
of the person whom it represents, without
losing its identity. The theme which has special
reference to Siegfried’s buoyancy of spirit, the
producer of youthful enthusiasm, is intoned by the
hero on his horn thus:—</p>

<div class='x-ebookmaker-drop'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

</div>

</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/music140b.jpg' alt='[Music]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In “Die Götterdämmerung,” when Siegfried has
become a fully developed man, this melody is modified
so as to signify his mature heroism. It is then
proclaimed by the orchestra thus:—</p>

<div class='x-ebookmaker-drop'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>[<a href="music/140c.mp3">Listen</a>] [<a href="music/140c.mxl">MusicXML</a>]</div>

</div>

</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/music140c.jpg' alt='[Music]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As the writer has had occasion to say elsewhere,
“The alteration to which the music is subjected
is one of rhythm. The <em>motif</em> changes from six-eight
to common rhythm. The effect produced is
one of those which are founded upon the nature of
music. A six-eight rhythm is light and tripping; a
four-beat rhythm is firm and solid.” This alteration
of the representative theme, then, “develops
the character of the melody along the same lines as
Siegfried’s character has developed,—from lightness
and ebulliency to firmness and solidity.” These
examples should be sufficient to give the reader a
tolerable comprehension of the manner in which
Wagner worked out his new operatic form. It
seems necessary now only to lay special stress upon
the suggestion already offered, that the listener
at the performance of a Wagner music-drama does
not treat either himself or the composer fairly when
he busies his mind wholly with the identification of
the themes as they present themselves successively
to his hearing. The proper effort is to get at the
organic connection between action or thought and
the music, to read each by the light of the other,
and to see whether it is not possible to penetrate
by means of the two into the spirit of the drama.
If the hearer accomplishes this, he will have at least
the right to say that he has approached the consideration
of this art work of Wagner’s in a spirit of
fairness; and though he may not know the title of
a single theme, he will have a far better understanding
of their meaning than they who have committed
to memory some one of the thematic handbooks.</p>

<p class='c007'>This exposition of Wagner’s theories will have
failed to achieve its purpose if the reader does not
now clearly perceive that its fundamental postulate
is that the opera is a <em>drama</em> in which music is merely
the chief vehicle of expression. This ruling idea led
Wagner not only to abandon the old formulæ, but
to do many things which would, perhaps, be inexpedient
to attempt in absolute music. The great
Bayreuth master has been severely censured, by
those who cling to the belief that music should
always be pretty, for having written many harsh
progressions and for having indulged in remarkable
boldness in his harmonies. These so-called sins of
the master must find their justification in the fact
that he was not aiming at purely musical beauty.
The whole purpose of his work was “exact and
lifelike embodiment of the poet’s thought.” When
the emotion of an actor was harsh, the music had
to be harsh. When the emotions were grand and
beautiful, the music had to be of a similar character.
It is for these reasons that we find the snarling anger
of Alberich and Mime, the bitter hatred of Ortrud,
the fury of Isolde, voiced in music which is not
pretty, but which is truthful. But on the other
hand, when Wagner has to express the sorrows of
the Volsungs, the fierce and sudden passion of
Siegmund and Sieglinde, the awful revulsion of
feeling in the death of Siegfried, or the highest
elevation of woman’s love in the last moments of
Isolde, he rises to a sublime height of melody, an
overwhelming dignity of harmony, and an irresistible
eloquence of instrumentation not equalled by
any other composer. As Louis Ehlert, not a
Wagnerite, has well said: “Wagner’s music
always impresses us with the idea that we are in
the presence of genius. It may at times be ugly,
obtrusive, and noisy; but it is never silly and
insignificant.”<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c009'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Much of the pungency of Wagner’s music, which
makes it disagreeable to timid ears, is due to his
progressiveness in the matter of harmony. He has
gone to the furthest limit in the use of passing
notes, as primarily embodied in the polyphony of
Bach. He has followed the rule thus formulated by
Dr. Parry:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suspensions are now taken in any form and
position which can in the first place be possibly
prepared even by passing notes, or in the second
place be possibly resolved even by causing a fresh
discord, so long as the ultimate resolution into
concord is feasible in an intelligible manner.”<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c009'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Many of Wagner’s harmonic progressions belong
to that class which instruct rather than obey the
theorists. These progressions have all been found
capable of justification by analysis, and will therefore
remain as part of Wagner’s contributions to the
development of musical science and art. In considering
these novelties, we must remember that
genius is usually in advance of its day, and what
sounded strange at first by reason of its novelty will
in good time become part of the common diction
of the art. In instrumentation, Wagner also made
many innovations, and it is indisputable that he was
the greatest master of the art of scoring who has
ever lived. He showed a profounder insight into
the individual capacity of every instrument than
any composer except Berlioz, and in fecundity of
combination he excelled even the gifted Frenchman.
He enriched the body of tone of the modern
orchestra by the employment of the tenor tuba, and
emphasized the value of the neglected bass trumpet.
His addition to the customary number of horn
parts splendidly improved the mellow tone and
solidity of the brass choir, and his use of the bass
clarinet, not simply as a solo instrument, but as a
re-enforcement of the organ-like bass of the woodwind
department, was a stroke of genius. He
further developed the expressiveness of the woodwind
band by the novelty of his distribution of
harmony among its members. Not only did he
allot solos to them with unerring judgment, but
departing from the conventional style of the classic
symphonists, who used their wood instruments in
pairs playing in thirds and sixths, he wrote for these
instruments in a marvellously effective dispersed
harmony. In writing for the strings, Wagner
divided them more frequently than his predecessors
had done, often making six or eight real parts
among the violins alone. Altogether his instrumentation
is richer in its polyphony and more solid
in its body of tone than that of any other composer.
He has been accused of being noisy, but power of
sound is not necessarily noise. There is more noise
in some of Verdi’s shrieking piccolo passages,
accentuated with bass-drum thumps, than in the
loudest passage that Wagner ever wrote.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taking him by and large, as the sailors say,
Wagner is the most striking figure in the history of
music. Whether the future will or will not accord
to him the position granted by the musical world of
the present—that of the greatest genius (though
not the profoundest musician) the art has produced—he
will remain fixed upon the records as the most
commanding intellect that ever sought to express
its thought and accomplish its purposes though the
medium of music. His influence upon his contemporaries
has been larger than that of any other
master since the science of modern music began.
One has only to study the latest operas of that real
genius, Verdi, to perceive how one of the most
gifted musical minds of our time was forced to
yield to the convincing truth of Wagner’s ideas.
As for those of less original force than Verdi,
they have one and all—even Mascagni, who is as
purely Italian as Wagner was purely Teutonic—been
swayed by his irresistible influence. Even
the symphonic writers have been guided by him,
and no man can ever again write an orchestral score
as if Wagner had not lived. The futile controversy
about his theories and his style will probably be
kept alive for some years by those who persistently
refuse to remodel their inflexible conceptions of
what ought to be after the splendid pattern of what
is. But Wagner’s theories will live, for he was the
fulfillment of the prophetic words of Herder on
Gluck: “The progress of the century led us to
a man, who, despising the frippery of wordless
tones, perceived the necessity of an intimate connection
of human feeling and of the myth itself
with his tones. From that imperial height on which
the ordinary musician boasts that poetry serves his
art he stepped down and made his tones only serve
the words of feeling, the action itself. He has
emulators, and perhaps some one will soon outstrip
him in zeal, overthrowing the whole shop of
slashed and mangled opera-jingle, and erecting an
Odeon, a consistently lyric edifice, in which poetry,
music, action, and decoration unite in one.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>MUSIC IN GERMANY</h2>
</div>

</div>

<div class='c006'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di-g.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Germany, the foremost of musical
nations, owes her present
supremacy not only to the genius
of her great masters, from Bach to
Wagner, but also in a large degree
to the native impulse of her people,
who for centuries have been distinguished for
their earnest love of music.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Middle Ages the Germans possessed in
their folk-songs (Volkslieder), Minnesongs and
church chorals a rich fund of music, inexpressibly
dear to the people. These precious heirlooms
have been cherished and preserved, and their peculiar
earnestness, purity of style, and depth of sentiment
have rendered them sources of lofty inspirations
to the great masters who have achieved for
Germany her world-wide fame in music. It is unfortunate
that our knowledge of German popular
music in the Middle Ages is not as full and trustworthy
as that concerning the beginnings of contrapuntal
art in the Netherlands,<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c009'><sup>[22]</sup></a> and the development
of Catholic Church music. We have the
best inferential evidence that the sense of melody
and rhythm existed in definite form among the people
earlier than in church music. This evidence
comes to us from an observation of the devices to
which the monks of St. Gallen resorted, in order to
popularize the Gregorian song in Germany. For,
whereas the plain chant of Gregory seems never to
have been musically enjoyable to the Germans, certain
<em>sequentiæ</em> introduced by these monks, notably
by Notker, surnamed the Stammerer († 912),
became universally popular among the people.
These “sequences” should not be confounded
with the so-called sequences defined in our modern
treatises on harmony. A sequentia was a hymn,
with words in rhymed Latin set to fitting music.
Such sequentiæ were sung by trained choirs at certain
moments in the service, and the congregation
joined in the phrases like “Kyrie” and “Alleluia”
which followed. “Veni Sancte Spiritus,” “Stabat
Mater,” and “Dies Iræ” are sequences of this
sort. These sequences are really concessions to
the popular taste of the time. The mass of the
people loved melody and rhythm, characteristics
which were ultimately recognized as necessary to
church music.</p>

<p class='c007'>The folk-songs of Germany are quite unlike the
Minnelieder (love-songs). This is evident both in
the words and melodies. The folk-song is more
naïve, tender and rhythmical than the heavy and
solemn Minnelied. In most cases the latter resembles
the choral in having slow and equal notes.
Comparatively few of the old folk-songs have come
down to us unchanged, and of still fewer do we
know the date of composition. Probably we owe
many of them to travelling minstrels, who went
about from place to place.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the sway of the Troubadours, the love of
poetry and song spread over Europe, and Germany
was directly influenced by them. The Minnesingers
were a similar class of knightly lyrists. Their
favorite meeting-place was the Wartburg, near
Eisenach, at the Court of Hermann, Landgrave of
Thuringia. Among the most celebrated of these
poet-singers were Wolfram von Eschenbach, Walther
von der Vogelweide, Heinrich Schreiber and
Heinrich von Zwetschin. The influence of the
Minnesingers was greatest in the thirteenth century,
and rapidly died out in the following. They were
succeeded by the Mastersingers who were of the
burgher class, and included in their ranks schoolmasters,
clerks and mechanics. The foremost
Mastersinger was Hans Sachs, the famous poet-cobbler,
who lived in Nuremberg in the sixteenth
century. The music of the Mastersingers was in
general heavy and expressionless, very much like
church psalmody.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wagner has immortalized both classes of mediæval
singers in his “Tannhäuser” and “Mastersingers,”
but the true source of his inspiration was
not their music, but the poetic and dramatic characteristics
of the picturesque life of those days.</p>

<p class='c007'>The folk-songs were more rhythmical and melodious
than either the Minnesongs or Mastersongs.
It is certain that as an element of influence in
the practice and development of music in the latter
part of the Middle Ages and at the time of the
Reformation, popular music
in Germany had risen
to an eminence hardly
second to the Gregorian
song.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the music of
the Minnesingers was a
direct outgrowth from the
folk-songs. Their poems
were composed principally
to interest those who
lived at court, but the
music, so far as it had
melodic character, was
imitated and developed
from the melodies of the
people. A rude and
simple instrumental accompaniment
was characteristic
of these productions.
The element of
declamation, too, must
have been very important,
for even up to the thirteenth
century the “singing” and the “saying”
of poetry were identical in meaning.</p>

<p class='c007'>The folk-songs had great influence, as we have
seen, on the melodic invention of composers of the
Reformation. Other influences were potent, however,
in determining the various forms of composition.
The development of counterpoint in the
Netherlands, and the higher <em>a capella</em> church style
in Italy, were important for Germany. Attempts
were made to treat secular melodies in the elaborate
style of the Netherlanders, with the melody in
the tenor, accompanied by several contrapuntal
parts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Heinrich Isaak, who was a member of the choir
of the Emperor Maximilian from 1493 to 1519,
enjoyed Italian training, and wrote sacred and secular
music in the prevailing Flemish style. He
won for himself the title of the “German Orpheus.”
His contemporary, Heinrich Finck, was likewise
famous and beloved. Also Stephan Mahu, a singer
in the choir of Ferdinand I., was of the same
school, and wrote motets and “lamentations” in a
simple but sublime style. The earliest Protestant
music was in the style of these masters, and the
choral with contrapuntal accompaniment was suggested
by their treatment of sacred chants and
secular melodies. Under
the influence of the Reformation,
sacred music
was cultivated with renewed
fervor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Martin Luther, the
head and front of the
great movement, took a
profound interest in
music, which he exemplified
by his noble “Ein’
feste Burg,” and other
melodies and hymns.
Associated with him were
the musicians Johann
Walther and Louis Senfl.
Their labors did not extend
beyond the middle
of the sixteenth century,
and may be said to mark
the first period of Protestant
Church music. Walther
was court musician
at Torgau when called
by Luther to Wittenberg to collaborate with the
singer, Conrad Rupff, concerning the arrangement
of the German mass. Walther’s choral book was
the first one published. It appeared at Wittenberg
in 1524, under the supervision of Luther, who wrote
a preface to the work.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus153.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic003'>
<p>LUDWIG SENFL.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The most able musical character of the period was
Ludwig Senfl. He was born and educated in Switzerland,
and was a pupil of Heinrich Isaak. He became
a member of the choir of Emperor Maximilian,
and in 1530 was chosen director of church music
at the Bavarian court in Munich, a position afterward
held by Orlando Lasso.</p>

<p class='c007'>Senfl was not only a composer of motets and
other church music, but also, according to the custom
of his day, set to music many ancient odes,
particularly those of Horace. A collection of these
odes was published in 1534 at Nuremberg. Senfl
did not compose original chorals, but in his contrapuntal
treatment of them displayed a higher degree
of skill and taste than his contemporaries, and he
was clearly the forerunner of masters like Eccard
and Michael Prætorius. A pure, religious spirit
animates his works, and the chaste style of his
themes and counterpoint renders his music interesting.
Among other masters of this period who were
influenced by the Flemish school may be mentioned
Heinrich Finck, Rahw, Resinarius, Agricola,
Duces, Dietrich and Stolzer. Finck is especially
noted for his motet-like arrangements of chorals;
and Rahw published in 1544 a collection of chorals
to which the above-named composers and others
contributed.</p>

<p class='c007'>As has been said, this activity in Protestant
music was not without parallel in Catholic music.
Indeed, the works of these same composers were
sung in the Catholic cathedrals of their native
land. Heinrich Isaak, who has already been mentioned,
was the only noteworthy composer of this
time who devoted himself exclusively to Catholic
Church music. His work, in common with that of
a multitude of lesser masters, was surpassed infinitely
by the achievements of Orlando Lasso. This
great musician, although a Belgian by birth, spent
much of his life in Germany, and from his prominent
position at Munich wielded a powerful influence
on the musical life of his age.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second period in the development of Protestant
Church music may be said to have begun
about the middle of the sixteenth century, when it
became the fixed custom to place the melody in
the highest part of the harmony. When given to
the tenor, the melody could never assert its rights,
for it was often lost in the polyphonic complexity
of the other voices. Its transference to the soprano—a
reform suggested by the <i><span lang="fr">stile familiare</span></i> of
Josquin de Près and by the Italian <em>frottole</em> and <em>villanelle</em>—had
been determined by the Calvinist
psalm collections of 1542 and later. This new
style of composition was assiduously cultivated during
the latter half of the century, and its ablest representatives
were Hassler, Eccard and Michael
Prætorius.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hans Leo Hassler was born at Nuremberg in
1564, and died in 1612. He was educated in
music by Andreas Gabrieli at Venice. He was
one of the first organists of his time, and a clever
contrapuntist and composer. Although a disciple of
the Venetian school, his compositions have a genuine
German simplicity and strength; but the most
justly celebrated German composer of the century
was Johannes Eccard, who was born at Mülhausen
in 1553. It was conjectured that he was a pupil of
Lasso. Eccard’s music is simple compared with
that of his contemporaries of the Venetian and
Roman schools. He was content to use his
gifts in a less pretentious way, but nevertheless
his Festival Songs deserve a place among the
best church music. They are a perfect embodiment
of religious devotion, and show a complete
mastery of the peculiar form which he adopted in
his music. In his works the melody appears in the
soprano, but is not sufficiently individualized to
be separated from the harmony. The parts are
generally five in number, they move freely, and are
well adapted to the voices of the singers. Eccard
was likewise the composer of sacred songs, which
are noble in comparison with similar music of his
day; but his attention was devoted chiefly to
church music. Two of his pupils became celebrated
musicians, Johann Stobäus and Heinrich
Albert. The latter had an important influence on
the early development of the German Lied.</p>

<p>TITLE-PAGE OF “SYNTAGMA MUSICUM.”<br>  <br>  (See page <a href='#Page_573'>573</a>.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_573'>573</span>One of the most prominent masters of the early
part of the seventeenth century was Michael
Prætorius (1571–1621). He witnessed the great
change which was then taking place in music,
but contributed nothing to it himself. He endeavored,
however, to educate his countrymen to
appreciate the new style of secular music which, in
Italy, was then making rapid headway in the operas
of Peri, Caccini and others. For a number of
years he was organist and director of music at
Brunswick, where he died. In his great admiration
and study of the new Italian masters, he did not,
like his eminent successor, Heinrich Schütz, lose
his nationality. The number of works he composed,
collected, and elaborated is two thousand.</p>

<p class='c007'>His most important contribution to music, however,
is his “Syntagma Musicum,” a theoretical work
of great value to students of musical history. Concerning
instruments and the theory of music, it is a
rich source of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the seventeenth century the opera was
invented and ardently cultivated in Italy. With
the adoption of the new lyric style of recitative
and aria, much greater scope was possible for
artistic instrumental music than ever before. The
violas and other bowed instruments were brought
into prominence, and in the course of the seventeenth
century formed the basis of the orchestra.
Yet, during the latter half of the sixteenth century
considerable use was made of instrumental accompaniment
in church music. In the choir, directed
by Orlando Lasso, in Munich, from 1569 till 1595
there were twelve bass singers, fifteen tenors, thirteen
altos, twenty sopranos, and thirty instrumentalists.
The Dresden band had ninety-three wind
and percussion instruments, and only thirteen
stringed instruments. The curious character of
some of these combinations is indicated in the
clearest possible way on the title-page of Prætorius’
“Syntagma Musicum.” Here we see three separate
choruses, each accompanied by a separate
organ. In the first of these (at the left of the
illustration) the voices are supported by stringed
instruments, in the second (at the right), by reed
instruments, and in the third, by trombones and
bassoon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hand in hand with the development of orchestral
accompaniment, the seventeenth century witnessed
a wonderful development of organ and
clavier playing. In this also Italy took the lead.
The first great artists in organ playing were Italians;
the most prominent of whom were Claudio
Merulo and Giovanni Gabrieli, appointed organists
at St. Mark’s in Venice in 1551 and 1557. A
noted disciple of this Venetian organ school was
the Netherlander, Jan Pieters Sweelinck, who
studied under Zarlino and Cyprian de Rore. Later
he was the teacher of various German organists,
among whom was Samuel Scheidt (1587–1654).
The “father of true organ playing,” Girolamo Frescobaldi
(1587–1640), organist of St. Peter’s in
Rome, wielded even greater influence on Germany
through his famous pupils, Caspar Kerl and Jacob
Froberger. Various forms of composition, whose
names suggest their Italian origin, became common
in Germany at this time; such as the capriccio,
the canzona, the toccata and the ricercata. In all
these forms fugal imitation is predominant, and
the modern fugue begins to take determined shape.
Pachelbel (1653–1706), a pupil of Kerl, was the
first to combine the various advantages of both the
German and Italian schools, and his works also
mark the establishment of the modern tonal system.
He made important advances in fugal art. We of
to-day recognize the wonderful artistic consistency
of Bach’s master-works in the fugue form. We
note that they are composed of various sections
which include separate developments of a principal
theme, and that these sections are connected
by episodical passages of a character similar to
that of the rest of the composition. But we are
apt to lose sight of the fact that this perfection of
form was of very gradual growth. Pachelbel was
the first to feel the necessity of attaining such
artistic unity by careful attention to these details of
construction. His successful endeavors to individualize
and to group his ideas give a hitherto
unknown clearness of form to his organ fantasias
and toccatas. In his fantasias especially he employs
rich figurations, but always with the evident
purpose of making such ornamentation naturally
grow out of the thematic material of the work,
and all is carefully designed with reference to the
nature of the instrument. His contemporary,
Johann Adam Reinken, who died in 1732, at the
age of ninety-nine, was, as composer and player, a
veritable virtuoso. Sebastian Bach made two journeys
to Hamburg for the purpose of hearing this
master play. But, among all the predecessors of
Bach in this branch, the most prominent was
Dietrich Buxtehude, organist at Lübeck from
1669 to 1707. In all respects he elevated the art
of organ composition and organ playing. The
structure of his themes shows the greatest appreciation
of the peculiar character of the instrument.
Two years before Buxtehude’s death Bach became
his pupil, and the influence of Buxtehude<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c009'><sup>[23]</sup></a> is seen
in the earlier organ compositions of Bach.</p>

<p class='c007'>Clavier, or clavichord, composition was of later
growth. At first, indeed, the same principles were
applied to both instruments. The earlier English
and Italian clavier masters used the various forms
of organ composition with little regard for the
different construction of the instruments. But as
time went on the less ponderous of the two instruments
became the exponent of the gayer moods, as
represented by various forms of the dance. Under
French masters, especially, the clavier began to have
a style of its own. The clavier suite, or <em>partita</em>, was
the favorite form, and consisted of a succession of
dance movements. The name sonata, now of such
definite meaning in connection with chamber music,
was at first represented by short Venetian organ
pieces. Subsequently, in the seventeenth century,
the sonata was a composition for one or more
violins with clavier. This originated in Italy under
Corelli and others, and was imitated in England by
Purcell, and in Germany by Biber and others. The
first application of the name sonata to a solo
for clavier was made by Johann Kuhnau, Bach’s
predecessor as cantor of the St. Thomas School at
Leipzig. His “Fresh Clavier Fruits; or, Seven
Sonatas of good Invention and adapted to the
Clavier,” shows by its title that this branch of composition
was receiving some attention at a time
which has been wholly eclipsed by the splendor
of the succeeding period.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this rapid sketch of the progress of organ
and clavier music during this period, which produced
but few works that have survived, we see how
steady was the development of the art which became
grand and ultimate in the works of Sebastian Bach,
and how intimate was this master’s connection with
the musical activity of his time. A similar review
of the course of the opera and the oratorio will
enable us to trace the growth of certain other art
forms which took definite shape before the dawn of
Germany’s musical greatness.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already spoken of the important influence
exerted by the folk-song on the German
church music of the sixteenth century. Hassler
was the first to attain a blending of the
folk-song style with that of older counterpoint.
He was aided in his striving by a study of the
Italian madrigals and villanelle. His dance-songs
are especially rich in melodic feeling, and
show that in the art of melodic phrasing he
followed closely in the footsteps of the Italians.
With the development of the instrumental accompaniment
early in the seventeenth century there
came certain changes of style. The ever-increasing
tendency of the time to allow the melody to
stand forth more prominently began to modify the
nature of the harmonic setting. The songs of Jeep
(1582–1650), and of his rival, Valentin Hausmann,
show degeneracy, while the songs of Adam Krieger
(1634–66) and Johann Krieger (1652–1736) are
noble examples of the new style. The melodies
of Johann Krieger are particularly charming,
and show strong rhythmical character and real
artistic power. He employs simple harmonies, yet
shows more freedom and naturalness in modulation
than any of his predecessors.</p>

<p class='c007'>We perceive in the music of these German masters
the universal sway which Italian opera already
began to exercise. The opera—as the special article
on Italian music fully describes—had its
beginning in Italy just at the dawn of the seventeenth
century. “Mysteries” and “liturgical
dramas”—both of them crude stage representations
of episodes in biblical history—had been
common in Germany long before this time; and
the church musicians—Isaak, Senfl, Walther, Lasso
and others—had worked to some extent in this
field. But it was not until the great Monteverde
(1568–1643) had embodied in his operatic works
the results obtained by the Bardi society of connoisseurs,
and not until Carissimi had done similar
service for the oratorio, that the new principles
began to take root and develop in Germany.
Johann Kapsberger, a composer, who resided at
Rome from 1610 to 1630, was the first German to
adopt, to a considerable extent, the new ideas concerning
vocal composition. But there soon arose
in Germany a number of composers who cultivated
the new style, especially the oratorio, without losing
their German characteristics. Johann Gottlieb
Staden (1581–1636), for instance, was a Nuremberg
composer of operettas. He had for his motto
in art, “Italians know not all, for Germans, too,
have thoughts.” The works of Staden show that
the Germans from the outset had a tendency to
characterize the personages of the drama by the
accompanying music. Unfortunately
the music of the first
serious opera, “Dafne,” by Heinrich
Schütz, the words of which
were translated from the text
of Rinuccini, has been lost. Although
a considerable amount
of creative energy was bestowed
on “Singspiele” and operas,
especially by amateurs, it was not
until theatres were established in
Germany that the opera enjoyed
a cultivation equal to that of the
oratorio and church music.</p>

<p class='c007'>The experiment of a permanent
theatre was first made at
Hamburg in 1678. The determined
zeal of Gerhard Schott, an
influential jurist of that city, made
the attempt successful, and as
long as he lived the opera did
not lack encouragement. This
period embraces over sixty years.
The first performance at this
theatre was a musical play by
Johann Theile (1646–1724), who
had been under the instruction
of Schütz in Weissenfels and
a former choir-master in Gottorp.
This sacred, allegorical work was
succeeded by a number of similar
pieces by the same composer.
Other successful masters of the
same period were Franck, Strungk, the celebrated
violinist; also Förtsche, Conradi and Kusser. The
last-mentioned composer was appointed conductor
in 1693, and was a worthy forerunner of Keiser.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reinhard Keiser was twenty-one years old when,
in 1694, he was appointed director of the Hamburg
opera. He was a man of undoubted genius. His
productivity as a composer was immense. His
works number about one hundred and twenty
operas, many of which contain, in addition to
choruses, recitatives, etc., no less than forty airs.
In all his serious operas there was no spoken
dialogue. His works were very popular throughout
Germany. His activity was not confined to the
stage, for he composed church music, passion
music and cantatas. He had a rare and seemingly
inexhaustible gift of melody, and his recitatives
are masterly, but his music lacks the breadth and
massive strength of his successor, Handel. “All
that Keiser wrote,” says Mattheson, “was uncommonly
easy to sing, and was so easily caught by
the ear that one enjoys it without feeling any respect
or intense admiration for it.” Keiser lacked
earnestness, and did not exert an enduring influence
for good on the Hamburg opera. He was willing
to lend his art to the most trivial and nonsensical
farce, in order to afford amusement to the rough and
common people. Mattheson compares him with his
more earnest contemporary, Rosenmüller, whose
sonatas were “like the fresh blue salmon of the Elbe,”
while Keiser’s light music was “like the smoked
golden herrings of the North Sea, which tickle the
palate, but awake a thirst for drink.” In place of
the sacred spectacles and plays which at the outset
had formed the subject of the drama on the
Hamburg stage, in the course of time the gods and
heroes of mythology, and vulgar farces, began to
divide the attention of the public. The stage
spectacle grew more and more sensational. Fireworks,
devils, serpents, dragons, battle scenes and
all kinds of noises and sights were introduced.
Not content with mere humanity on the stage,
various animals became personages in the drama,
and mingled their outcries with the music of the
orchestra. Then again, in some operas, no less
than four different languages were spoken and sung
indiscriminately; yet in spite of all these absurdities,
the Hamburg opera remained worthy of the services
of a Handel or a Mattheson.</p>

<p>FIRST SCENE IN KEISER’S OPERA OF “HANNIBAL.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>John Mattheson was a
Hamburger by birth, and
began his musical career
as a singer at the opera.
He made his last appearance
in that capacity in
Handel’s “Nero” in 1705.
Mattheson was a man of
remarkable versatility of
talent. He was a very prolific
composer, but did not
possess great originality
nor depth of conception.
He was a good actor,
singer, and a finished performer
on the harpsichord.
As a literary musician he
still holds an eminent
place. He used his facile
pen in the composition of
an opera, or passion, or in
the preparation of a musical
essay; also in the translation
of some such pamphlet
as that on “The
Properties and Virtues of
Noble Tobacco.” His
music, which once found
so many enthusiastic admirers,
is no longer performed,
but his writings are
still of value to students of
musical literature. His
most famous books are
“The Complete Art of
Conducting,” “The Newly Opened Orchestra,”
and the “Triumphal Arch.” The last is especially
valuable as a source of information concerning the
lives of musical artists. These works have a place
in every complete musical library.</p>

<p class='c007'>A more gifted musician was Georg Philipp Telemann,
who was born four years earlier than Handel
and Bach. Telemann was the last famous composer
for the Hamburg theatre. His works are
more distinctly German than the majority of those
of the period, which was thoroughly under the influence
of Italy in all matters pertaining to opera
Telemann’s name marks the decline of the Hamburg
stage. The time was not yet ripe for a distinctively
national style of opera. It was destined
for Gluck and Mozart, half a century later, to reform
and develop German opera.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has already been said that the oratorio enjoyed
at first a steadier and more constant development
in Germany than the opera. Heinrich Schütz,
whom we have mentioned as the author of the first
opera given in Germany, was also the first prominent
oratorio composer. He was born in 1585.
By frequent visits to Venice, where he studied with
Gabrieli, he kept himself in touch with the musical
life of Italy. Although Dresden was the scene of
his principal labors, the last twenty-five years of his
life were spent in Weissenfels, where he died in
1672. His larger works are “The Passion” according
to the four Evangelists, the “Story of the
Resurrection,” and the “Seven Last Words.” In
the second of these works, produced in Dresden in
1623, the form of the modern oratorio is clearly
defined. The customary “Introitus” is for six-part
chorus, and the words of the Evangelist are
intoned. The more significant passages of the text
are selected for characteristic music. The <em>dramatis
personæ</em>—the Saviour, the Angel, Mary Magdelene,
and some of the disciples—are given prominence
and individuality in various <i><span lang="it">cantilene</span></i> movements,
sometimes for one or two voices. This
distinguishes the new form of oratorio from the
older, in which everything was performed by choral
masses. In Schütz’s sacred symphonies and concertos
he attained far greater finish and variety in
the solo numbers, and greater mastery in general.
By his attempts to tell the story in dramatic form,
without the aid of scenery or action, Schütz became
the real founder of the modern German oratorio.
We cannot suppose, however, that Handel was acquainted
with the music of Schütz, for before the
end of the seventeenth century his works were generally
forgotten; but his greater freedom of treatment,
and dramatic interest, established ideals in
Germany which prevented the oratorio from yielding
in that country to the degenerating theatrical
influence which had such baneful effect on all forms
of sacred music in Italy at this period.</p>

<p class='c007'>Contemporary with Schütz was J. H. Schein,
who was noted for his sacred concertos. Johannes
Rosenmüller, who died in 1680, effected a more
regular construction of the concerto. His works in
this form consist of a series of separate movements,
which show unity of character by the repeated
presence of some principal thought. Thus the
form of the cantata was established, in which Bach
afterwards displayed such wonderful activity. The
immediate predecessors of Bach were Johann Rudolph
Ahle (1625–73), and his son Georg Ahle
(1650–1706). In the oratorios of the latter the
form of the aria is clearly defined.</p>

<p class='c007'>The account that has been given of the development
of Protestant Church music, and organ and
clavier music, previous to Handel and Bach, may
serve to show the foundations on which their monumental
works were built. It was Handel’s mission
to reconcile the church and secular styles in his
great oratorios. His long career as a dramatic
composer served as an admirable school for his
talents; and when in middle life he abandoned the
field of Italian opera for the oratorio, he was so
well equipped that his triumphs were but as the
natural result of his former discipline. His forty
operas shared the fate of all operas of that time;
not one holds a place on the modern stage. The
operas of Handel are not musical dramas in the
sense of the present day. They consist chiefly of
a string of airs, with little or no dramatic action.
His stage heroes are generally trivial and insipid.
It was destined for Gluck and Mozart to reform the
traditional Italian opera. Handel was content to
avail himself of the conditions of the opera as they
then existed. His opera airs are the best of his
time; they are lyric, but not dramatic.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dramatic talent of Handel did not find
expression in his operas but in his oratorios. The
great heroes of Jewish history, like Samson, Saul
and Judas Maccabæus, are represented in a combined
narrative and dramatic form. Many of his
oratorio solos are more dramatic than his opera airs.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the oratorio of “Samson,” for instance, the
characters of Samson, Delila, Minoah and Micah
naturally suggest the dramatic scene. But it is
especially in the conflicting ideas and emotions of
the people—the chorus of Israelites, in opposition
to the chorus of Philistines, the heathen priests of
Dagon, and the chorus of Virgins of Delila—that
the dramatic conflict is sharply defined with
sublime choral effects. His choruses are elemental
in their irresistible and overwhelming power when
sung by large masses of voices. In this respect his
choruses are unique and have never been equalled.
While Handel’s oratorios in general hold the middle
ground between the secular and church style of his
time, Bach’s great choral works belong more distinctly
to the older church style of Schütz and others.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Palestrina marks the culmination of the unaccompanied
(<em>a capella</em>) church music of the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries, so Bach is the highest representative
of Protestant Church music. Yet he is more
than this, for in his sacred cantatas and passions he
reveals a nature more profoundly religious than
even Handel or Palestrina. His Passion music to
St. Matthew has no rival in its special form. It is
the sublimest conception in music of the trials and
death of Jesus. Among similar works before and
during Bach’s time, his passions are the only ones
that have lived. The oratorio has replaced the
passion; but the older form as perfected by Bach
possesses a certain reality and intensity of religious
fervor that not even the grandest oratorios of Handel
can match, except possibly the “Messiah.” Notwithstanding
the sublimity, variety and vocal effectiveness
of the latter work, the St. Matthew Passion
surpasses it in lyric pathos and dramatic fire. Handel’s
long experience with the public, his Italian
vocal training, the example of Purcell and other
masters of the English anthem, were important factors
in his artistic development, and enabled him
to carry the art of solo and chorus composition to
the highest perfection. On the other hand, Bach’s
difficult choral style suggests the organ, and his airs,
though full of religious pathos, are often stiff and
archaic in style.</p>

<p class='c007'>Great as Bach is in his vocal works, he is still
greater in his instrumental music. Through him,
for the first time in history, instrumental music
reaches a point of influence where it predominates.
He is justly considered as the true progenitor of
modern instrumental music, and largely to his influence
we owe the subsequent wonderful development
of this youngest branch of art. Handel, on
the other hand, had little influence on instrumental
music. His counterpoint is more vocal than instrumental;
he makes a more limited use of dissonances
and modulation. Bach stood far in advance
of his time in these respects, and anticipated many
of the effects of the present day. His remarkable
use of chromatic and enharmonic modulation is
exhibited in all his principal works, especially in
such movements as the great organ Fantasia in G
minor. (Volume II., Peters’ Edition.)</p>

<p class='c007'>As a master of the fugue, nay, of all polyphonic
writing, Bach stands pre-eminent, a model for all
time. We are overcome by the inexhaustible
wealth of his ideas, that seem as boundless as the
forces of nature, and we constantly feel the emotional
depth and romantic sentiment of this wonderful
artist.</p>

<p class='c007'>He not only perfected the stricter forms of counterpoint,
but the older, lighter forms found their
ideal in his charming clavier suites, violin sonatas,
etc. His “Well-Tempered Clavichord” is a unique
work, one of the corner-stones of modern music.</p>

<p class='c007'>Above all, his organ works are the very central
point and acme of his achievement. The great Prelude
and Fugue in A minor, the Fantasia and Fugue
in G minor, the Toccata in F, the Passacaglia, and
other organ compositions are to be classed with
Beethoven’s symphonies as among the greatest
works of art.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding the attempt to establish German
opera at Hamburg, Italian opera held full sway in
Germany until the influence of Gluck and Mozart
was felt.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the time when the great achievements of
Sebastian Bach were almost entirely unrecognized
and unappreciated by his countrymen, his contemporaries,
Hasse and Graun, were lauded to the
skies, and the operas of the Neapolitan school, with
their singer-triumphs, held all Europe in subjection.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Italians Steffani, Cimarosa, and Jomelli lived
in Germany, and their works were often given in
the principal opera houses. It was then only natural
that Germans should seek public favor by adopting
the prevailing musical style. Chief among the
writers in the Italian style were Johann Adolf Hasse
(1699–1783), Karl Heinrich Graun, and Johann
Gottlieb Naumann. The number of Hasse’s compositions
is extremely great. They include operas,
oratorios, masses, cantatas, and instrumental movements
of every kind. The florid style of Italian
vocal composition predominated in his music. The
harmonic structure is of the simplest nature, and
his instrumentation is without individuality. He
had better taste than most Italians of his time,
and showed greater dramatic instinct. On the
whole it may be said that he represents the highest
attainment of the Italian opera of the school of
Scarlatti. The music of Graun, who was born in
1701, is not so purely Italian in style, and certain
of his sacred works, notably his passion music, entitled
“Tod Jesu” (Death of Jesus), are known at
the present time. His recitatives, like those of
Hasse, are dry and insignificant. On the contrary,
his arias are more pleasing, and show the influence
of Keiser. The songs of Graun deserve mention.
The compositions of Naumann (1741–1801) display
perfect facility in the Italian style; his career,
however, was interrupted by the appearance of
Gluck and Mozart in the operatic field.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gluck had a long experience as a dramatic composer
before he entered on the path which has
rendered his name illustrious in the annals of
music. He was already
advanced in years when
he turned his back on the
Italian opera, and disclosed
his plan of reform.
His principles applied
only in their full force to
the degenerate <em>opera seria</em>
of that period. These
ideas were by no means
original with him; they
had previously been accepted,
and realized by
other musicians. They
were, however, first
brought into the foreground
by the production
of his “Alcestis,” “Orpheus,”
“Iphigenia,” and
other mature works, and
divided the musical world
of that time into opposite
parties.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is remarkable that
Gluck, who fought against the musical inconsistencies
and defects of his time, should not have
felt the necessity of reforming the dramatic construction
of the opera, for he showed a much
keener insight and appreciation of dramatic effect
than the poets whose librettos he composed. He
knew how to give characteristic expression to the
personalities of the play. His characters may be
read like an open book. In simplicity and dignity
of style he approached the Greek ideal.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Gluck increased the significance of accompanied
recitative and insisted on truer methods of
declamation, he would not allow the air the same
prominence that the Italians did. His airs are
divested of all richness of ornament and colorature.
Many of them are noble in their simplicity, but in
general they lack sensuous charm and beauty.
The chorus was a very important feature of his
operas, and fulfilled something like its original
object in ancient tragedy. In his dramatic use of
the orchestra, Gluck stood in advance of his time.
He added new instruments, and produced original
and impressive effects which render his orchestration
interesting to musicians of the present day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notwithstanding the nobility and grandeur of his
conceptions, he neither fulfilled the ideal of the
musical drama from the
point of view of Wagner,
nor of the opera as perfected
by Mozart. The
latter embodied Gluck’s
ideas in works which surpass
his in every respect
except dramatic simplicity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The field of music in
which Mozart stands pre-eminent
is the opera.
He was endowed by
nature and favored by
opportunity to bring this
form to ideal perfection,
at least as regards the
musical element of the
opera of his time. He
learned first of the Italians
and then of Gluck,
and surpassed the highest
accomplishments of both.
“Don Giovanni” and
“Figaro” are the greatest of Italian operas. No
one has ever united more perfectly than Mozart
precision and energy of dramatic expression with
the richest and purest melody. His dramatic characters
are thoroughly individualized by the music.
Each one appears on the stage to remain true
and consistent to his or her individuality in every
phase of passion and conflict of action. This
power of contrasting characters is especially vivid
in his concerted music, in the inimitable quartets
and sextets of his latest operas. For this
purpose, Mozart exercised his perfect command
of vocal composition and polyphony.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before his time the orchestra, as a means of dramatic
expression and coloring, was not appreciated,
although Gluck pointed out the way. Under
Mozart it became more symphonic and massive in
character. The solo instruments became refined
organs of feeling, giving color and sensuous beauty
to the vocal parts. The orchestration intensified
the dramatic fire of the scene from beginning to
end. In his operas every feeling of the heart finds
utterance. A divine harmony and classic purity of
form distinguish his dramatic music, as, indeed, all
his music, from the little minuets which he composed
as a child to his last operas and symphonies.
During the time of Gluck and Mozart the German
operetta came into existence. Mozart’s “Entführung”
(Belmont and Constanza) is the noblest
example of this style. This new form of musical
drama was suggested by the French comic opera.
It adopted the spoken dialogue for the less dramatic
moments of the play. It resembled, however,
the French operetta only externally, and soon
developed a genuine German character. This new
species of musical play sought to do that which the
brilliant and conventional Italian opera could not
accomplish, namely, interest the great masses of the
people. This was at first possible only through
inartistic exaggeration of the realities of life, and
by the introduction of humorous elements of a
distinctly coarse kind. But the general demand for
musical plays of this class gradually attracted to
their composition writers of real musical and
dramatic ability.</p>

<p class='c007'>Johann Adam Hiller (1728–1804) was the first
German who became prominent as a composer of
operettas. “Lottchen at Court,” “Rustic Affection,”
and “The Hunt” are his principal operettas.
The last named was given not less than forty times
during a short theatre season in Berlin in 1771.
Even before this time the operetta had become so
generally popular that a writer had had occasion to
remark that tragedies and legitimate comedies were
being driven to the wall. Yet there was one serious
obstacle to the operetta’s rapid artistic development.
The good singers were monopolized by
theatres giving Italian opera, and operetta managers
had to take what was left.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vienna soon began to acquire the prominence in
operetta performances for which it is distinguished
at the present day. In 1778, the erection by
Joseph II. of the “Deutsches Nationalsingspiel”
was a sign of the growing popularity of this new
form of entertainment, and gave a powerful incentive
to the composers of such works. Operettas of
Gluck, Mozart, Salieri, Umlauf, Schenck and others
attained great popularity here. In 1786, Carl Ditters
von Dittersdorf scored a signal success with his
“Doctor and Apothecary.” This versatile musician
soon became a favorite of the entire nation. Born
at Vienna in 1739, he first became prominent as a
violinist. Later his symphonies, concertos, quartets,
oratorios, etc., became well known. In all these
forms, however, he was surpassed by others. He
possessed, it is true, much cleverness, but his counterpoint
was not faultless, and he wrote too much and
too superficially. In comedy and farce he took the
lead. His melodies are lively and flowing, characteristic
and very catching. He learned much from
Haydn, but something also from French composers.
His “Doctor and Apothecary,” “Jeremiah Knicker,”
and “Red Riding Hood” gained for him great popularity.
In all, he wrote twenty-eight such works.
His autobiography, published in 1801, two years
after his death, is also a work of remarkable freshness
and interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Gotha, the conductor, George Benda (1721–99),
produced operas which became popular in
Germany. His melodramas, in which the text
was spoken to the accompaniment of fitting music,
were novelties, and became even more favorably
known. Munich was identified with more serious
undertakings in dramatic music through Peter von
Winter (1754–1825), Court Kapellmeister. This
once highly esteemed master composed numerous
operas, the most popular of which were “The
Labyrinth,” “Marie of Mantalban,” and “Unterbrochene
Opferfest.” The last is still occasionally
performed. Likewise Mannheim—which from
Mozart’s time until to-day has been devoted to
the highest interests of music—became the scene
of serious operatic endeavors. Ignaz Holzbauer
(1711–83) wrote several operas during his conductorship
of the theatre in that city.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most prominent of the composers who succeeded
Dittersdorf was Johann Friedrich Reichardt,
whose interesting literary work, “Letters of an
Observant Traveller,” is full of useful information.
Born in 1752, he became orchestral conductor to
Frederick the Great in 1775, and was salt-inspector
in a town near Halle, at the time of his death
in 1814. He was liberally educated, travelled
much, and was acquainted with many of the prominent
persons of his time. Few of his works have
lived, and those which have survived are chiefly
songs. He produced, however, an enormous
amount of music. His imagination was not equal
to his understanding or his artistic intentions, and,
indeed, he was to a great extent a mere copyist.
A single new form is due to him, the “Liederspiel,”
the musical part of which, as the name suggests,
consists only of songs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The development of the opera in Germany, during
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, has
now been traced, and next we will turn our attention
to the progress of instrumental
music after Sebastian
Bach.</p>

<p class='c007'>No more remarkable
instance of lack of appreciation
of a great man’s
genius has ever been known
than that furnished by the
history of Bach’s works.
The reasons for this are
perhaps twofold. Like
Shakespeare, Bach must
have been ignorant of the
supreme excellence of his
artistic creations. Hence,
like many other great men,
he occupied himself little
with the dissemination of
his works, except those used
in teaching. Not only the
musical world, but even
Bach’s immediate family and pupils were unable
to appreciate his significance and to use his compositions
in a way most advantageous to the development
of music. It would indeed be interesting to
know what difference it might have made in the
development of music in Germany if Haydn, and
especially Mozart, had enjoyed opportunities of
intimate acquaintance with Bach’s works.<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c009'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>JOHANN FRIEDRICH REICHARDT.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Only a few of his organ compositions, the “Well-Tempered
Clavichord” and some of his other clavier
music, seem to have been generally known in
Haydn’s and Mozart’s time. It was only indirectly
through his sons and other pupils that his powerful
influence on instrumental music was then felt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among Bach’s numerous pupils the most noted,
besides his own sons, were Krebs, Altnickol, Agricola,
Vogler, and the theorists, Marpurg and Kirnberger.
His most distinguished sons were, Wilhelm
Friedemann, Carl Philipp Emanuel, Johann Christoph
Friedrich, known as the Bückeburg Bach, and
Johann Christian, called the Milanese Bach. Wilhelm
Friedemann Bach (1710–84) was the eldest
son of Sebastian Bach. He was a genius, and his
father bestowed great care on his musical training,
and had great hopes of his future. He studied at
the St. Thomas School and university of Leipsic,
where he distinguished himself in mathematics.
For a number of years he
held a position as organist
at Dresden. In 1747
he became director and
organist at Halle. In later
years he led a wild and
wandering life, and finally
died in utter want and
misery in Berlin. He was
perhaps the greatest organist
of his time, and was
famous for his wonderful
improvisations. He wrote
a large number of compositions,
many of which are
preserved in the Berlin
Royal Library, but few of
which are published.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carl Philipp Emanuel
Bach was born at Weimar
in 1714. In his youth he
studied law thoroughly, and busied himself with
music rather as an amateur than as one who intended
to make it a profession. His attention was
devoted chiefly to piano playing and the art of
improvisation, which, thanks to his father’s rare
teaching, he carried to the highest degree of perfection.
He was destined, after all, to make music
his life-work. He had hardly completed his university
studies when he received an invitation
from the crown prince of Prussia, afterward Frederick
the Great, to accept a musical position at
court. He accepted, and remained in his service
for a number of years. In 1767 he became
successor of Telemann as conductor of the opera
at Hamburg, where he remained until his death.
By his daily practice in improvisation, Emanuel
Bach acquired a freedom and elegance of style
equalled by no other German master except his
father. His position and intercourse with the
best society were not without good influence on his
music. He possessed hardly a tithe of his father’s
genius; but, as he lived more in the world, he
became a man of fashion and popularity. In his
day his name was far better known than that of his
father, and musicians looked upon Emanuel Bach
as the great authority. Even Mozart said of him:
“He is the father; we are mere children. Those
of us who can do anything right in music have
learned it of him. Although we could not be satisfied
nowadays to do what he did, nevertheless, no
one was able to equal him in what he did.” He
was an inferior vocal composer. It was chiefly as a
clavichord player and composer that he took first
rank. His refined style and uncommon finish of
execution excited universal wonder. Emanuel Bach’s
vocal works embrace two oratorios; twenty-two
passions; sacred cantatas; Singspiele; sanctus for
two choirs; sacred and secular songs, etc. His
works for clavier are very numerous, consisting of
sonatas, concertos and solos. Eighteen of his
orchestral compositions are published by Breitkopf
and Härtel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Emanuel Bach’s talent as a teacher was evinced
in his celebrated treatise, “On the True Art of
Playing the Clavichord,” which contains the principles
of all good piano playing. But his greatest
services to modern music were rendered in his
sonatas and symphonies, in which he not only
enlarged the form, but also increased the means of
expression and of instrumental effects. Emanuel
Bach exercised a great influence on the clavier sonata,
and first brought it into prominence. The so-called
sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti were single, brilliant
movements which resembled the prelude. Sebastian
Bach’s sonatas for the organ, clavier and violin, etc.,
in three or four movements, were more or less
fugal and strict. Emanuel Bach combined the
solidity of the style of his father with the brilliancy
and lightness of Scarlatti. Although it remained
for Haydn to develop fully the principle of free
thematic music, the germ of the modern style
existed in the sonatas of Emanuel Bach. The
habit of improvisation gave full scope to the play
of his imagination, and consequently his works are
characterized by a certain ease and brilliancy which
distinguish him from his predecessors. He made
more use than formerly of contrasted themes in the
several movements of the sonata, and they were
brought into relation to each other by means of free
passages. His “Salon” style is distinguished for
its elegance and grace, ornateness and playfulness,
and well represents the polite world in which he
lived.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having traced the early development of organ
and clavier music, we will turn our attention, for a
moment, to the growth of orchestral music to the
advent of Haydn, and the so-called classical period
of modern instrumental music. During the first
half of the seventeenth century the instruments
used in connection with the opera served a subordinate
position. The accompaniments of the
recitatives and arias consisted of a ground bass
(<i><span lang="it">basso continuo</span></i>) for chittarone, organ, clavier, etc.,
which supplied the chords indicated by figures. In
the opera-madrigals the orchestral accompaniment
was simply a reproduction of the vocal parts, on
wind and stringed instruments. In the course of
time instrumental ritornelli were introduced to
relieve the solo voices, and melodic phrases were
given to the instruments. The first operas generally
opened with a flourish of trumpets or with a
madrigal played by the instruments alone; sometimes
dances played by the instruments were introduced
in course of the opera.</p>

<p class='c007'>The opera overture was invented subsequently,
probably by Lully. It consisted, at first, of three
short movements, slow, quick, slow. Scarlatti and
his contemporaries adopted the overture, and
changed the order of the movements to <em>allegro</em>,
<em>adagio</em>, <em>allegro</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the perfection of the violin and the other
stringed instruments, about the beginning of the
eighteenth century, solo playing became more and
more artistic. With Corelli, sonatas and suites for
one or more violins and clavier became the fashion.
At this time the orchestra was well organized, so far
as the true relation of the string band to the wind
instruments is concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cultivation of chamber music was encouraged
by titled and fashionable people, and virtuosos on
various orchestral instruments appeared. Thus instrumental
music began to be cultivated independent
of the opera and church music.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus174.jpg' alt='CHARLES PHILIPPE EMMANUEL BACH' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The three-movement form suggested by the
overture was the type of this independent orchestral
music, under the names of symphony, concerto, or
suite. Such were the orchestral symphonies of Sammartini,
the famous Milanese conductor of the first
half of the eighteenth century. His is the first
prominent name in this field. He was soon followed
by German composers, among whom were
Stamitz, J. C. Bach, Abel, Wagenseil, Cannabich
and Emanuel Bach.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among noted German instrumental soloists of
this period were Johann Georg Pisendel (1687–1755),
who was celebrated as a violinist, and composed
concertos for solo violin and string quartet,
which were considered as among the best of that
time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Franz Benda (1709–86), Georg Benda and Ignaz
Holzbauer (1711–83) were likewise able masters
of the violin, and had large experience as orchestral
musicians.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under Stamitz and Cannabich the Mannheim
orchestra became a famous organization.</p>

<p class='c007'>Johann Karl Stamitz, who was born in 1719,
became in 1745 director of music for the Elector
of Mannheim. His works have no interest for the
hearers of to-day, but in the characteristic elements
of the modern form, they represent a distinct advance
over those of his predecessors. In general, they
are imitations of the symphonies of Sammartini.
The pupil and successor of Stamitz, Christian Cannabich,
was born in 1731. Considering the superlative
praise which Mozart bestowed upon this
conductor, we cannot doubt that the playing of the
Mannheim band was of great service to Mozart in
his orchestral works, by increasing his knowledge of
instrumental expression.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1756, the year of Mozart’s birth, this orchestra
had two concert masters, ten first and ten second
violins, four violas, four violoncellos, two contra-basses,
two flutes, two oboes, two bassoons, four
horns, twelve trumpets, two kettle drums, two organists,
besides twenty-four singers. About 1767
clarinets were added, and years later Mozart
learned how to use the clarinets from hearing them
in the Mannheim orchestra.</p>

<p class='c007'>Burney says of the Mannheim orchestra, “This
is the birthplace of the crescendo and diminuendo”;
and the philosopher, Schubart, is recorded as saying
of the orchestra under Cannabich, “Here the
forte is a thunder, the crescendo a cataract, the
diminuendo a crystal stream babbling away into
the far distance, the piano a breeze of spring.”
As for the symphonies of Cannabich, they do not
seem to represent any advance toward the establishment
of modern form.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the preceding account it will be seen that
the external form of the symphony was already
partly determined when Haydn began his artistic
career. Under his treatment and that of his successors
its growth, in all respects, was marvellous.</p>

<p class='c007'>Haydn is justly called the real creator of the
modern symphony and string quartet. He enlarged
the works, as a whole, extended the separate movements
in their larger and smaller divisions, and
developed the so-called art of free thematic treatment.
He first gave musical clearness, order and
variety to the form, and adapted it to the expression
of the multitude of different phases of musical
thought. The stricter thematic imitations of the
older masters gave way to that free thematic play
which has been an element of all concert music
since his time.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Haydn’s development of this principle we
recognize a power of invention and fertility of
imagination only equalled by few others. The
originality of Haydn cannot be over-estimated.
He discovered a new world in music. An infinite
variety of musical effect was produced by his new
art of motive-building. Haydn also laid the foundation
of modern orchestration. He understood, as
no one before his day, the true scope of the combined
stringed instruments. In his string quartets,
even more than his symphonies, his mastery of the
technical effects of the solo strings is most complete;
for though the possibilities of tone-color
are greater with the full orchestra, yet in Haydn’s
quartets there is a wealth of musical expression and
a certain charm of style which place them beside
those of Mozart and Beethoven.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tragic fire and grandeur of thought so
characteristic of Beethoven have their counterpart
in the geniality, humor and playfulness of Haydn.
The symphonies of Beethoven may be compared
with tragedies, Haydn’s with comedies. “Papa”
Haydn is never tragic nor sarcastic. His seriousness
is imbued with contentment, never tinged with
despair. He overflows with good humor, and is
fond of a musical joke now and then; yet he is
intensely serious at heart, and his mirthful compositions
never leave the impression of superficiality.
Haydn prepared the ground for Mozart and
Beethoven. One master cannot be considered
without reference to the other. Mozart and Beethoven
obtained the form of the symphony from
Haydn; on the other hand, it was not until Mozart’s
last works had appeared that Haydn produced his
finest symphonies and quartets. In his use of the
wind instruments, Mozart was the indispensable
teacher of both Haydn and Beethoven.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Mozart did not enlarge the general form of the
symphony, etc., as given by Haydn, but he rounded
and beautified the details of the several movements.
His themes and melodies are more beautiful and
expressive, and their working up more impressive
and emotional. Mozart’s last works have that perfection
of form and depth of sentiment which
belong only to the highest manifestations of genius.
Mozart left his stamp on all branches of music;
he is rightly considered as the universal master. It
was his mission to unite and beautify the national
differences of style, and give them the impress
of his own rare individuality. European music,
for the first time in history, was concentrated
in him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beethoven in his earlier period shows the influence
of Haydn and Mozart, yet he set the
stamp of originality on his very first works. He
was destined to bring the higher forms of instrumental
music to the highest point of development.
Although he ultimately revealed a new world in his
mature works, he remained true to the “sonata”
form from first to last. He did not seek to revolutionize
musical form; on the contrary, he built on the
solid foundations already laid. Great as were his
achievements as a musician, in the grand outlines
and proportions, dynamic expression, thematic
treatment and instrumentation of his works, we
lose sight of the musician in contemplating the
greater tone-poet, who touched every chord of the
heart, who uplifted and broadened the minds and
souls of men, whose long struggle to rise above the
sorrows and ills of life endowed his music with
a spirituality and religiousness beyond that of all
others, and which places him among the greatest
poets and prophets of humanity. Further considerations
on Beethoven as composer are contained
in the special article of this work. (See page 337.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Before Beethoven fully entered on his great
life-work, Haydn and Mozart had spread the fame
of German music throughout the world. Their
influence was universal, and they had many disciples
and imitators, of whom Gyrowetz, Pleyel,
Wranitsky, Kozeluch, Romberg, F. E. Fesca,
Eybler, Süssmayer and Seyfried were prominent.
These composers enjoyed great popularity for a
time, and assisted in spreading the love of instrumental
music among the people; but as their music
was devoid of originality and marked individuality,
it has not survived. Of these masters, perhaps the
most noteworthy were Pleyel, Romberg and Gyrowetz.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ignaz Joseph Pleyel (1757–1831) was the favorite
pupil of Haydn, who had a high opinion of
Pleyel’s abilities. Though not so productive as his
teacher, Pleyel was a very facile and pleasing composer;
his many symphonies, quartets and quintets
were very popular for a long time. Greater things
were expected of him than he fulfilled; even Mozart,
on hearing one of Pleyel’s earlier quartets,
thought that he might some day replace Haydn.
But Pleyel did not progress; his later works copied
Haydn’s style without his spirit, and consequently
his music has entirely died out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Andreas Romberg (1767–1821) sprang from a
very musical family, which counted among its
members a number of noted musicians. His
cousin, Bernhard Romberg, was the celebrated
violoncello virtuoso and composer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Andreas began his career as a concert violinist;
subsequently he was court chapelmaster at Gotha.
He composed several operas, church music, six
symphonies, and chamber music. His most popular
cantata, “The Lay of the Bell,” is still occasionally
sung in England and America. The music
of Romberg is pleasing and well written. Mozart
was evidently his model.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most eminent of all these epigones was
Adalbert Gyrowetz (1763–1850), who presents the
melancholy example of an able and worthy master
who entirely outlived his fame. As a young man
he had a brilliant reputation in France and England.
From 1804 to 1831 he was conductor of
the Imperial Opera at Vienna, where many of his
operas were produced. Gyrowetz composed thirty
operas, Singspiele, and melodramas, and over forty
ballets.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among his best operas were “Der Augenarzt,”
“Die Prüfung” (which Beethoven liked), “Agnes
Sorel” and “Helene.” He also composed four
Italian operas, nineteen masses, besides many
other vocal works. He was equally prolific in all
forms of instrumental music, and wrote over sixty
symphonies and as many string quartets, besides
quintets, overtures, serenades, marches and dances
and numerous sonatas, trios, nocturnes, etc., for
the pianoforte. Gyrowetz possessed many of the
qualifications of a great composer, yet he lacked
the one thing needful,—originality. His facility
betrayed him into weakness, and unconsciously he
became an imitator of Haydn and Mozart. He
witnessed the entire rise and culmination of
Beethoven’s genius. As he outlived Beethoven
by twenty-three years, he must have fully realized
the epoch-making character of his great works.
Gyrowetz suffered from neglect and poverty in his
old age. None of his music is known to the present
age, and his name is hardly remembered, except
by those familiar with musical history. In
the annals of music there is no more striking example
of one who accomplished so much who was
destined to see it all pass away and fall into oblivion.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of the eighteenth century, under
the sway of the opera and the free forms of instrumental
music, the style of church music in general
became more melodious, ornate, and sensuous, but
less earnest and religious in tone, than in the time
of Bach and Handel. Eberlin and Michael Haydn
were prominent representatives of this lighter style.
Mozart’s earlier church compositions were modelled
on theirs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Michael Haydn (1737–1806), brother of Joseph
Haydn, wrote a large number of masses, requiems,
litanies, vespers, offertories, oratorios, cantatas,
German sacred songs, as well as operas. Mozart
and his father had a high opinion of his church
music; Joseph Haydn considered it superior to his
own: time, however, has reversed his judgment.
Michael Haydn’s mass in D minor, “Lauda Sion,”
and “Tenebræ” in E flat are still prized by musicians,
but the mass of his works are forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'>Representatives of the more severe church style
in Germany during the eighteenth century were
Fux, Fasch and Albrechtsberger. Johann Joseph
Fux (1660–1741) was chapelmaster of St. Stephan’s
and court composer in Vienna.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fux had a rare mastery of counterpoint, which he
exercised in his numerous church compositions.
His “Missa canonica” is a marvel of canonic skill
and ingenuity, and replete with effects of modulation.
His fame, however, rests on his transcendent
abilities as a musical theorist. His treatise on
counterpoint, “Gradus ad Parnassum,” has remained
in use for more than a century and a half.
There have been many editions; it has been translated
from the original Latin into German, French,
Italian and English. Both Joseph and Michael
Haydn were indebted to the “Gradus” for their
knowledge of counterpoint, and Mozart studied it
with equal diligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carl Friedrich Christian Fasch (1736–1800) is
known chiefly as the founder of the celebrated
Singakademie of Berlin. Fasch was industrious as
a composer in the <em>a capella</em> style. His sixteen-part
mass is his most important work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Johann Georg Albrechtsberger (1736–1809) was
court organist and chapelmaster at St. Stephan’s of
Vienna. He composed over two hundred and
sixty works, among which his “Te Deum” is best
known. Albrechtsberger was especially distinguished
as a musical theorist and teacher. Among
his pupils were Beethoven, Hummel, Seyfried and
Eybler. His strict system did not satisfy Beethoven;
yet the exercises published as Beethoven’s
“Studienbuch” show the benefit that he had received
from Albrechtsberger’s instruction.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most curious and remarkable characters
of this period was George Joseph Vogler,
called Abt Vogler (1749–1814), whose exact place
in musical history is not easy to determine. In his
own day a wide divergence of opinion was expressed
as to his merits; by some, including Mozart,
he was considered to be a veritable charlatan,
by others an “epoch-making” artist. Want of
space precludes an extended account of his career,
which was full of picturesque incidents. Vogler
travelled much, and tried his fortune in various
places; wherever he went he drew attention by his
organ playing, his revolutionary ideas on teaching
harmony, and innovations in organ building.
Vogler was a religious devotee; at Rome he was
made Chamberlain to the Pope, Knight of the
Golden Spur, and Abbé. He was remarkably active
as composer, teacher, organ player, and theorist.
He wrote for the theatre as well as the church.
Although most of his music is shelved, his Requiem
and Symphony in C are not forgotten. Mendelssohn
bought out his symphony at the Gewandhaus;
the Requiem contains original and impressive
effects.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vogler’s vanity led him to harmonize chorals in
order to show how much he could improve on
Sebastian Bach. His organ playing was degraded
by descriptive “thunder-storms” and other claptrap
effects. With all his faults, he was a man of
ideas, and as a teacher aroused genuine enthusiasm
among his pupils. His attacks on various established
errors and prejudices of music appealed
strongly to his young disciples, Von Weber and
Meyerbeer, and fired them with knightly ardor.
All his pupils were devoted to him; he was equally
fond of them, and called them his “boys.” The
picture of Vogler’s home life at the Tonschule at
Darmstadt is charming. His pupils were his
friends and companions. Weber wrote, on hearing
of Vogler’s death,
“Our beloved master
will ever live in our
hearts.” Browning
has celebrated Abt
Vogler in his remarkable
poem bearing that
name.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the later half
of the eighteenth century
the pianoforte
gradually superseded
the older clavichord.
With the rapid improvements
in piano-making,
piano playing
and composing became
more and more
artistic. Haydn, Mozart
and Clementi
were influenced at first
by the clavier style of
Emanuel Bach, but
soon developed new
features in their piano
works. Clementi, especially,
carried technique to a point beyond others
of his time. His celebrated studies, “Gradus ad
Parnassum,” are indispensable in the training of
pianists.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Mozart brought the piano concerto into prominence,
and set the example followed by Beethoven
and others in this form. The concertos of Mozart
are his chief compositions for the pianoforte. The
best of them have a place beside his last symphonies
and string quartets. The grace and elegance
of his piano style, and the perfect balance
between the solo instrument and the orchestra,
render his concertos models of form and beauty.
Among the contemporaries and followers of Mozart
and Clementi in this branch were Steibelt (176&#160;–1823),
Sterkel (1750–1817), Kozeluch (1753–1814),
Hässler (1747–1822), Gelinde (1757–1825),
Dussek, Woelfl, Hummel, Cramer and
Field. Johann Ludwig Dussek (1760–1872) was
a brilliant representative of the piano style, who
showed originality in his modulations and use of
dissonances. There is a certain romantic feeling
that characterizes his best piano compositions, as for
instance, his “La Consolation” and “La Chasse.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joseph Woelfl (1772–1812)
had a brilliant
career as a piano virtuoso.
He visited Paris
and London and other
cities, where his playing
created great astonishment.
At Vienna
he met Beethoven (in
his younger days) as
a friendly rival in extemporaneous
playing.
Notwithstanding the
partisan feeling among
their audiences, personally
they appeared
to have a mutual respect
for each other.
Though Woelfl had
greater execution and
equal facility in improvising,
Beethoven
excelled him and all
others in imagination
and inspiration, in the
power of moving the
feelings of his listeners. Woelfl was noted for his
breadth of style, as well as his breadth of hand-grasp;
with his enormous hands he could cover
two thirds of the key-board.</p>

<p class='c007'>Johann Nepomuk Hummel (1778–1837) was the
favorite pupil of Mozart. To Mozart’s example
Hummel owed his delicate touch, his elegant and
finished execution, his skill in improvisation, the
clearness and solid construction of his pieces,—characteristics
which rendered him in his prime the
best representative of the expressive style. For a
time he was even considered as the equal of
Beethoven as a piano composer. Nowadays
Hummel is underrated and called a “dull classic.”
His septet in D minor is a masterpiece, and a few
of his best piano concertos and sonatas are worthy
of study. His two masses are sterling works.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_589'>589</span>Johann Baptist Cramer (1771–1858) forms the
link between Clementi and Hummel. Cramer was
noted for his expressive touch on the piano. His
numerous sonatas, etc., are shelved, but his noble
piano studies live as classical models. They hold
almost a unique place, for they combine beautiful
musical ideas with systematic technical training.
In these respects they excel the “Gradus” of his
teacher, Clementi. They are indispensable to
every thorough student of the instrument.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two other talented pupils of Clementi should be
mentioned: Ludwig Berger (1777–1838), the distinguished
pianist, composer, and teacher of Mendelssohn,
Taubert, Henselt and others; and August
Klengel (1784–1852), who is less known as a
pianist than as the composer of canons and
fugues, which show a remarkable command of
counterpoint.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beethoven’s great influence on piano music is
dwelt upon in the special article (see page 337).
His pupil, Ferdinand Ries (1784–1838), was one
of the leading pianists of his day, and was also a
productive composer in all branches of music. As
he was under the spell of Beethoven’s genius, he
failed to show any marked individuality of style.</p>

<p class='c007'>His contemporary, Wenzel Tomaschek (1774–1850),
displayed more originality, though he, too,
was overshadowed by Beethoven’s greatness. Tomaschek,
during his long career, was highly esteemed
as a composer, pianist and teacher. His
admirers called him the “Schiller of music,” on
account of his pure and elevated musical thought.
His numerous piano compositions merit more appreciation
than they have generally received. Schumann
admired his music. His “Eclogues” and
“Rhapsodies” are charming, naïve, imaginative
and original.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having given an account of the principal contemporaries
of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven in
dramatic, church and instrumental music, a few
words should be added on the subject of German
song composers prior to Schubert.</p>

<p class='c007'>The national sentiment which encouraged native
opera led also to a revival of interest in the German
Lied. It was not until the second half of the
century, when operettas had become the rage in
Germany, that talented musicians turned their attention
to this neglected branch.</p>

<p>JOHANN NEPOMUK HUMMEL.<br>  <br>  Portrait by F. H. Müller, engraved by Esslinger.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Emanuel Bach and two other pupils of his
father, Christian Nichelman (1717–81) and Johann
Friedrich Agricola (1720–74), devoted themselves
considerably to song composing. All the
operetta composers we have previously mentioned
composed separate songs, which, together
with single numbers of their operettas, attained
widespread popularity. One of the best song
composers of the time was Johann Peter Schulz
(1747–1800). His “Lieder in Volkston” were
modelled on the old folk-songs of Germany. Schulz
had true German lyric feeling; he pointed out
the way followed by Schubert a generation later.
Schulz’s songs have long been universal favorites.
It is a strong evidence of the innate naturalness
and strength of his songs that they should have
retained their place in the affections of the youth
of Germany. They are still sung in German school-rooms.</p>

<p class='c007'>As German literature began to free itself from
French influence, which had been so potent during
the reign of Frederick the Great, poets arose
who gave voice to true German feeling and sentiment.
The lyrics of Hagedorn, Gellert, Klopstock,
Gleim, Kleist and others furnish
material for composers. Bürger, the celebrated
author of “Lenore,” enriched German literature
with his ballads, many of which became popular in
musical form. It was Herder who revived true
enthusiasm and feeling for the old Volkslied, and
with the rise of Goethe’s genius a new era dawned
on lyric poetry, and inspired song composers to
take higher flights. Johann Rudolph Zumsteeg
(1760–1803) was the pioneer composer of ballads.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reichardt, of whom mention has already been
made, was the first to win
general approbation by his
settings of Goethe’s lyrics.
Carl Friedrich Zelter
(1758–1833) was more
closely identified with
Goethe, both as friend and
composer. In 1800, Zelter
became director of the
Berlin Singakademie. He
established the first male
chorus club (Männergesangverein)
of Germany,
which became the model
of the many similar clubs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Haydn, Mozart and
Beethoven did not devote
special attention to song
composing; their life-work
was accomplished in a larger
field. Yet the canzonets
of Haydn, the charming
“Veilchen” of Mozart and
the romantic “An die ferne
Geliebte” of Beethoven
are songs of much greater merit than any others
of their time, prior to Schubert.</p>

<p class='c007'>The example and presence of Beethoven inspired
Schubert to take the highest flights in his music.
Like his great pattern and guide, he lived withdrawn
from the public, and devoted himself heart
and soul to the pursuit of his beloved calling.
Schubert’s numerous symphonies, quartets, sonatas,
masses, cantatas and oratorios are among the priceless
possessions of musical art. It is, however, as
a song composer that Schubert stands forth as
a great and original master. In Schubert’s instrumental
music the fecundity of musical ideas, the profusion
and beauty of melody, which never failed him,—in
a word, the wealth of his lyric power,—often
stand in the way of the clear and cogent thematic
development of his music.</p>

<p class='c007'>Schubert speaks the sincere language of the
heart, and captivates the ear with the exquisite
beauty of his melody. He gave new significance
to the instrumental accompaniment, using it both
to intensify the emotional expression and to enhance
the effectiveness of the vocal part. His rhythm is
manifold and animated; his harmony strong and
daring. “He understood how to make the hearer
believe that the keys of C
major and F sharp minor
are twin sisters,” says a
well-known critic. Nor is
it alone the lyric power
which moves us in listening
to Schubert’s songs. When
the situation demands it,
certain epic and dramatic
characteristics come to
light: as in the “Erlking,”
perhaps the most popular
of all ballads. The unflagging
spontaneity which
distinguishes his songs has
not been matched by any
of his successors; and his
productiveness was something
marvellous. “If fruitfulness,”
says Schumann,
“be a characteristic of
genius, Schubert is certainly
one of the greatest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been the custom
among historians of music
to consider the epoch of the older masters
as the “classic period,” and to apply the term
“romantic school” to a long list of modern composers
of which Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn,
Spohr and Weber are the most important names.
Such a classification is of considerable convenience;
particularly as the so-called romantic movement
which pervaded literature was not far from
contemporary with the appearance of these composers.
But it would be difficult to define and
enumerate the various elements which enter into
the adjective “romantic” as used in this connection;
for nearly all the praiseworthy characteristics
of these later composers are present in certain
great works of the so-called classical composers,
not excepting him who is considered so “unsympathetic”
by many of the enthusiastic admirers of
modern music, Sebastian Bach. It is certainly true
that the tone-poems of Beethoven possess romantic
characteristics which have been misunderstood or
ignored by those who claim for his successors a
wholly new direction of musical development. But
in a general way we recognize in modern “romantic”
music the tendency to set less value on musical
construction or form for its own sake than on
the subjective expression of musical ideas. Further
than this there has been a tendency to enlarge the
scope of descriptive music, not only in connection
with the drama, but in the application of fanciful
titles to instrumental movements as exemplified by
the piano pieces of Schumann.</p>

<p>JOHANN PETER SCHULZ.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As we have said, the same period was not without
strong indications of similar changes in the
domain of letters. We have not space to give
details of literary history, but it may suffice to
point out that, with the advent of the music of
Weber, Schumann and others, Germany was
overflowing with intense sympathy and enthusiasm
for the writings of Byron and of the prose-poetizer,
Jean Paul Richter.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the general mental and emotional tendencies of
the epoch, classic calm and reflectiveness began to
be lost in “romantic” storm and stress. The first
indications of the new school of composition are to
be found in the works of two musicians whose lack
of appreciation of Beethoven’s genius is one of the
anomalies of musical history. Both of them—Spohr
and Weber—were great men, epoch-makers
in certain things. The compositions of the former
have, indeed, been eclipsed by later achievements
in music; but we ought not to underrate Spohr’s
progressive zeal. His musical individuality was
narrowed by mannerism; and yet within the limits
of that individuality the variety of his work is enormous.
In the development of violin technique his
activity as teacher and soloist has borne rich fruit.
His double quartets for strings have become well
known, but perhaps the general popularity of Spohr’s
works in this exceptional form has militated against
their performance, and consequently against the
appreciation of other interesting works for odd
combinations of a small number of instruments, as
for instance his octet and nonet.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus187.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic003'>
<p>CARL FRIEDRICH ZELTER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Weber, more than Spohr or any previous master,
realized for the German people their ideal of a
truly national style of opera. His “Der Freischütz”
appealed irresistibly to the popular taste for the
romantic and supernatural, a phase of imagination
embodied in the fairy tales and domestic poetry of
Germany. Spohr, in his “Berggeist,” “Faust”
and “Jessonda,” had already worked in this field
with considerable success; but Weber, with greater
musical genius, created in his “Der Freischütz” an
opera which was destined to take as deep a root
in the hearts of the German people as the “Zauberflöte”
of Mozart, or “William Tell” of Schiller.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, “Euryanthe,” the most important
work of Weber from the musical dramatic
point of view, did not win universal favor at first;
but nowadays it is estimated at its true worth. In
this masterpiece, Weber pointed out the direction
which Wagner instinctively followed, a new path
which led to stupendous results in his music-dramas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Heinrich Marschner as a dramatic composer was
stimulated and influenced by his friend and associate,
Weber. “Hans Heiling” is considered his
masterpiece. We feel the influence of Weber and
Marschner in the earlier operas of Wagner, though
almost from the outset his powerful originality
asserted itself. Lesser lights of the so-called
romantic school were Lindpaintner (1791–1858)
and Reissiger (1798–1856). The best of Lindpaintner’s
numerous operas were “Der Vampyr,”
“Der Bergkönig” and “Die Sicilianische Vesper.”
Some of his symphonies, overtures, etc., were highly
esteemed by his contemporaries, but his most popular
works were his songs, of which his “Roland”
and “Standard Bearer” are celebrated. Lindpaintner
was one of the foremost orchestral conductors
of his time. Reissiger succeeded Weber
as conductor of the Royal Opera at Dresden. His
most popular operas were “Turandot,” “Ahnenschatz”
and “Adele von Foix.” They are no
longer given on the German stage. “Kapellmeister”
music well describes the works of both Reissiger
and Lindpaintner. They had nothing in particular
to say, and said it thoroughly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before Wagner’s conquest of the stage the opera-loving
public of Germany were largely under the
sway of foreign composers. The sudden and universal
popularity of Rossini, Bellini and other
Italian composers absorbed public attention, and
native composers were cast into the shade. The
example of Meyerbeer was hardly stimulating to
the national musical feeling. Meyerbeer, it is
true, was a German, trained by German masters,
but his masterpieces were written for the Paris
Opera: his “Robert,” “Prophet” and “Huguenots”
are eclectic in character, in which Italian,
French and German elements of style are blended;
hence his world-wide influence has not been as a
German, but as a cosmopolitan in music.</p>

<p class='c007'>This indifference of the German public was not
confined to the field of opera; even Beethoven was
neglected during the era of Rossini, and did not
live to see his symphonies appreciated by the
many. With the rise of Mendelssohn and Schumann,
however, a new impulse was given to German
music, and the great public trained to appreciate
the older as well as newer masters. Under
the shadow of the St. Thomas School of Leipsic,
with its glorious musical traditions, a group of
gifted artists assembled, who represent a new and
bright epoch in the further development of modern
music. Mendelssohn’s noble character as a man,
his earnest, aspiring devotion to his art, cannot be
over-estimated. His remarkable gifts as composer,
pianist, and conductor served to gain the attention
of the public everywhere; and this advantage, combined
with his personal magnetism, enabled him to
accomplish more for the advancement of music
than others of his time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mendelssohn’s genius was exercised in almost
every form of musical composition, except the
opera.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two peculiar phases of his musical
individuality which are most remarkable: first,
the fantastic, imaginative vein so happily brought
to light in his scherzos, the most charming of which
is the scherzo in the “Midsummer Night’s Dream”;
second, the lyric element, which is not only characteristic
of his “Songs without Words,” but of
nearly all his slow movements. His most poetical
and romantic works are his concert overtures to
“Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “Fingal’s Cave,”
“Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage,” “Melusina”
and “Ruy Blas.” These overtures are “program”
music in the best sense of the term, and
hold a unique place among the foremost.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mendelssohn’s genial and refined nature mirrored
itself in his music. Nevertheless, with all the
beauty, sweetness, classic form, and purity of his
music, one thing is missed,—tragic depth and fire.
He did not touch the deepest chords of the heart
like Beethoven and Bach, perhaps because his existence
was not clouded by adversity, or because he
arrived without serious struggles at the complete
development of his artistic powers.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus190.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic003'>
<p>CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC IN LEIPSIC</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Schumann, on the contrary, for years was denied
the artistic opportunities and companionships for
which he longed. It was only in his maturity that
he acquired the technical facility which had become
second nature with Mendelssohn long before
he was of age.</p>

<p class='c007'>In depth of sentiment and emotional power,
Schumann was the worthy successor of Beethoven.
Like Mendelssohn, he was an earnest student of
Bach’s music, and we perceive the influence of the
older master in such compositions as Schumann’s
fugues on Bach’s name, the finales of his piano
quartet and quintet, and the grand polyphonic
opening of his C major Symphony. Like the old
Leipsic cantor, Schumann was a subtle ponderer
and deep thinker. As a harmonist he showed more
freedom and boldness than Mendelssohn. In his
orchestration he followed the footsteps of Mendelssohn,
but does not show equal mastery. His
piano works stand higher, and here he owed much
to Chopin, whom he appreciated more keenly than
did Mendelssohn, and followed his example in the
use of extended chords, unusual figures of accompaniment,
pedal effects, etc., as well as in poetical
imagination, that rendered every little dance or
melody a miniature poem in tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his four great symphonies, Schumann ranks
next to Beethoven and Schubert. As a song composer
he stands nearest to Schubert in spontaneity
and poetic feeling. In spite of the gloomy melancholy
that broods in some of his music, he, like
Beethoven, was a true humorist. Schumann did
not abandon the symphonic form, as perfected by
Beethoven, but, like Schubert and others, stamped
it with his own individuality; his poetical and
romantic nature are revealed in all his creations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the gifted associates and disciples of
Mendelssohn and Schumann were the following
composers:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Niels Wilhelm Gade (1817–91) first attracted
attention by his “Ossian” overture. The production
of his first symphony, under Mendelssohn’s
direction at the Gewandhaus in Leipsic, made his
name generally known; and subsequently Gade
was associated with Mendelssohn as conductor of
the Gewandhaus concerts. Although Gade was
under the influence of Mendelssohn and Schumann,
his musical nature was not the reflex of theirs; on
the contrary, his Danish nationality comes to light in
his works. His style is truly poetical and vigorous.</p>

<p class='c007'>William Sterndale Bennett (1816–75), the most
gifted English composer since Purcell, should be
mentioned here as the friend of Mendelssohn and
Schumann. He profited by their advice and enthusiasm,
but his style is his own, although undoubtedly
influenced by Mendelssohn. His charming
overtures, “The Naiads” and “The Wood Nymph,”
have a place among classical orchestral music.</p>

<p>FERDINAND HILLER.<br>  <br>  From a photograph from life by Eilender, of Cologne.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Ferdinand Hiller (1811–85) followed more or
less in the footsteps of Mendelssohn, and his works,
though finished in form and pleasing, lack strong
individuality, and, with few exceptions, have remained
unfamiliar except to cultivated musicians.
His pianoforte concerto in F sharp minor, and his
oratorio “Destruction of Jerusalem” are among his
best works. Hiller occupied a very influential position
as a pianist, conductor and writer. His extended
and intimate acquaintance with most of the
musical celebrities of his time renders his writings
of particular value. His “Aus dem Tonleben” and
“Persönliches und Musikalisches” are delightful
reading and the source of useful information.</p>

<p class='c007'>Julius Rietz (1812–77) was closely associated
with Mendelssohn and influenced by his style. His
concert overture in A major, Lustspiel overture,
and Symphony in E flat are his most successful
works. His best reputation rests on his great abilities
as an orchestral conductor and his technical
scholarship.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>CARL REINECKE.<br>  <br>  From a photograph from life by Brokesch, of Leipsic.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>While Rietz was conductor of the Gewandhaus
orchestra, from 1848 to 1860, he accomplished the
most important work of his life, namely, the correction
of errors that had crept into the scores of the
great masters. In the complete edition of Beethoven’s
works, published by Breitkopf and Härtel,
Rietz edited the symphonies. He was also editor
of the complete edition of Mendelssohn’s works.
Carl Reinecke (born 1827), the present conductor
of the Gewandhaus concerts, stands at the head of
musical life in Leipsic. As a composer he is to be
considered to some extent as a follower of Schumann.
He has been productive in nearly all forms of composition,
and exhibits everywhere thorough
practical experience and refined musical
taste, yet few of his larger works have won
great prominence. On the other hand, his
smaller piano compositions are highly
prized. His overture, “König Manfred,”
and his piano concerto in F sharp minor
are favorites.</p>

<p class='c007'>Woldemar Bargiel (born 1828) is considered
as one of the foremost disciples
of Schumann. Some of his chamber music
and especially his noble overture to
“Medea” have taken high rank among
later compositions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adolph Jensen (1837–79) was an enthusiast
for Schumann, and took him as
his model. He wrote cantatas and piano
compositions that are much admired, and
his songs have made his name famous.
Jensen was a born song composer, and
his melodies have rare sensuous charm
and sentiment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Friedrich Robert Volkmann (1815–83)
belongs also to the romantic school.
Schumann exercised a great influence on
him in his piano works, which bear
fanciful titles.</p>

<p class='c007'>His two symphonies and his string
quartets are admired for their solid style,
yet this music is not sufficiently spontaneous
in melody and marked in style to
gain universality.</p>

<p class='c007'>Norbert Burgmüller (1810–36) and
Hermann Goetz (1846–76) were not
spared to fulfil the promise of their gifts. Burgmüller
left two symphonies, an overture, and other
compositions which are of decided merit. Schumann
declared that since the untimely death of
Schubert there was no more deplorable event than
the loss of Burgmüller.</p>

<p class='c007'>Goetz was first made known to the musical world
by his opera, “The Taming of the Shrew,” which
achieved a rapid success. He did not live to
finish his second opera, “Francesca di Rimini,”
which was subsequently completed by his friend
Frank. His Symphony in F has been played in
Europe and America.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_595'>595</span>Franz Lachner (1804–90) was one of the most
popular composers of South Germany. He sprang
from a musical family. His father was an organist,
and his brothers Ignaz and Vincenz were prominent
musicians. Like so many other “Kapellmeister”
composers, Lachner has been wonderfully prolific
and facile in all forms of music, without accomplishing
anything truly original or great. His best
symphonies are those in C minor, D minor and
D major. His suite in D has been much admired.
Kalliwoda, Vierling, Dorn, and Taubert belong to
this same class.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wilhelm Taubert (born 1811) was fellow-student
with Mendelssohn under Ludwig Berger. He was
a brilliant pianist and well-trained
composer. For many
years he was conductor of the
Royal Opera at Berlin. His
operas, symphonies and other
large works have not prominence,
but his songs have a
pleasing quality that has made
them universal favorites.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mention should be made of
Julius Otto Grimm (born 1827),
whose ingenious and effective
“Suite in Canon form” has
found a place everywhere on
concert programmes; and Salomon
Jadassohn (born 1831), the
eminent musical theorist of the
Leipsic Conservatorium. His
treatises on Harmony, Counterpoint,
Fugue, etc., are among
the best. His powers as a composer
have been displayed in
his symphonies, chamber music, etc. His serenades
for orchestra are especial favorites. He shows
great facility in canonic writing.</p>

<p>FRIEDRICH ROBERT VOLKMANN.<br>  <br>  From a photograph from life by Keller &#38; Borsos, of Budapest.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Among German composers of choral works,
during the present century, the following have been
prominent:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Friedrich Schneider (1786–1853) was eminent
as a teacher and conductor, and as a composer
excelled in the church and oratorio style. His
oratorios, “Das Weltgericht” and “The Deluge,”
are his best known works. (Robert Franz was one
of his pupils.) Bernhard Klein (1793–1832)
was also a worthy representative of the sacred
style. His oratorio of “Job,” his motets and other
church compositions are pure and religious in
feeling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moritz Hauptmann (1792–1868), one of the most
eminent musical theorists of the nineteenth century,
was also a composer of true merit. His earlier
compositions were mainly for the violin, in which he
showed his affinity with Spohr. His vocal works
are more important, and include two masses, motets,
three-part vocal canons, and sacred songs; these
works hold a place among classical church music.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eduard Grell (1800–86), director of the Berlin
Singakademie, was an able representative of <em>a
capella</em> choral music. His sixteen-part mass is a
masterpiece of polyphonic skill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Friedrich Kiel (1821–85) is
pre-eminent among recent masters
of sacred music for his
depth of religious feeling and
perfect polyphonic art. His
“Requiem,” “Missa Solemnis”
and oratorio, “Christus,” are
noble and profound works.</p>

<p class='c007'>Albert Becker (born 1834),
the well-known Berlin conductor,
is the composer of a “Reformation
Cantata” and “Mass
in B flat minor” which take
high rank among compositions
of their class. Among numberless
works for male voices,
none have been more highly
esteemed than those of Carl
Friedrich Zöllner (1800–60)
and Heinrich Esser (1818–75).
The latter is distinguished
for his refined and
melodious style. His numerous songs and part songs
are universal favorites, and are held in high
esteem by cultivated musicians. His symphonies
and suites are also well known. Wagner entrusted
Esser with the arrangement of his “Meistersinger”
for the piano. Esser’s arrangements for orchestra
of Bach’s organ “Passacaglia” and “Toccata in F”
are skilfully done.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lighter style of opera has been well represented
in Germany, during the present century,
by Lortzing, Flotow, Von Suppe, Brühl, Johann
Strauss and others.</p>

<p class='c007'>Albert Lortzing (1803–51) is known and loved
by all Germans in his operas, “Die beiden Schützen,”
“Czar und Zimmermann,” “Der Wildschütz”
and “Der Waffenschmied.” These are stock pieces
in the repertory of every German theatre, and never
fail to delight audiences. The “Czar und Zimmermann”
is a universal favorite. His serious opera,
“Undine,” on the contrary, is a labored effort in
an uncongenial field; but it has succeeded in holding
its place on the German stage. As a composer
of comic opera, Lortzing is thoroughly delightful in
his naturalness and straightforwardness. His opera
texts—written by himself—are full of movement
and variety, and their <em>naïveté</em> is never synonymous
with dulness. His “character”
<em>rôles</em> are especially full of
possibilities for clever actors.
Lortzing’s pleasing operas
have shed the light of wholesome
and lively entertainment
into many millions of lives.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_596'>596</span>The “Nachtlager in Granada,”
by Conradin Kreutzer
(1782–1849), is familiar
enough to all German theatregoers,
although its composer
has retained his popularity
rather by his songs and male
choruses.</p>

<p class='c007'>More famous than Lortzing,
though less meritorious, was
Friedrich Flotow (1812–83).
Of his fifteen or more operas,
“Stradella” and “Martha”
are the only ones universally
known. The artistic aim of
Flotow was not high, yet his
talent enabled him to make
a distinct contribution to the
“light literature” of music. Certain of the melodies
of “Stradella” and “Martha” have more sentiment
than is usual with the music of this class. Nevertheless,
the popularity of these two operas seems to
be on the wane, and it is possible that Flotow may
be known only by name to the next generation.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Otto Nicolai (1810–49), director of the Domchor
and Royal Opera of Berlin, composed a number
of conventional Italian operas and other works.
His “Merry Wives of Windsor” is one of the most
popular comic operas of the present time. The
overture is especially charming, and a great favorite
in the concert-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Franz von Suppe (1820–92), “the German
Offenbach,” composed an immense number of
pleasing operettas and vaudevilles, of which his
“Fatinitza” is celebrated. His overture to the
“Poet and Peasant” is one of the most popular
light overtures ever written.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ignaz Brüll in his opera “Golden Cross,” and
Victor Nessler in his “Piper of Hamelin” and
“Trumpeter of Säkkingen,” have achieved success.
Their great popularity in Germany is an illustration
of the fact that the opera public in general have a
different standard of taste than cultivated musicians.</p>

<p class='c007'>Johann Strauss (born 1825),
the younger, has won great
success with his operettas.
His “Fledermaus” and “Der
Lustige Krieg” are known all
over the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the field of dance music
Germany leads the world.
The strains of Lanner, Gungl,
Waldteufel and Strauss are
heard in every land. For
piquancy, sensuous charm of
melody, rhythmical swing, thematic
contrast and effective
orchestration, the waltzes of
Lanner and Strauss are to be
classed with the most artistic
productions of modern Germany.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since Schubert’s day, the
German Lied-form has been
cultivated by many composers,
the noblest of whom are
Loewe, Schumann, Franz,
Rubinstein and Brahms.
Loewe and Franz were specialists, but their songs
are very unlike. In Germany, Loewe has been
especially popular with the masses, while Franz,
by his exquisite taste and feeling, appeals more
strongly to cultivated musicians. In certain respects
Franz and Schumann share with Schubert
in the fulfilment of the highest ideal of the German
Lied.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carl Loewe (1796–1869) was a productive composer
in various fields of music, but his reputation
rests on his merits as a ballad composer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The number of his ballads which have gained
universal popularity is very great. Among them
may be mentioned “Edward,” “Herr Oluf,”
“Abschied,” “Goldschmieds Töchterlein,” “Der
Wirthin Töchterlein,” “Die Braut von Corinth,”
“Heinrich der Vogler,” “Erlkönig,” and “Die
Gruft der Liebenden.” His musical style is remarkable
for its dramatic picturesqueness and
justness of declamation. With him everything is
made to contribute to a full rendering of the
meaning of the text. His works have become
very popular, and their popularity is by no means
on the wane. It is remarkable, however, that
beyond the boundaries of Germany his ballads
are but little known.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_597'>597</span>The musical productiveness of modern Germany
has been displayed in no single branch so overwhelmingly
as in songs. It may truly be said that
every composer, great and small, has produced his
sets of Lieder, though it has been vouchsafed to
only a chosen few to merit distinction in this over-crowded
field. Among the multitude who have
composed songs in a light style are several whose
services to popular music ought not to be underestimated.
The most prominent of this class are
Heinrich Proch (1809–78), Friedrich Kücken
(1810–82), and Franz Abt (1819–85). Of these,
Abt is the ablest and the most widely known.
Most of his songs are trivial in character, but a few,
like “When the Swallows Homeward Fly,” have
touched the popular heart and deserve their widespread
fame.</p>

<p class='c007'>The preceding brief account of the minor
composers of Germany, belonging to the “classical”
and “romantic” periods, may serve to show
that in art as well as nature the “survival of the
fittest” seems to be the governing principle of
evolution. Comparatively few works of musical
art are monumental, and survive the changes of
fashion, the inconstancy of the public, and the
ravages of time. Among the crowd of masters
who are grouped around the central figures are
some who merit a better fate than has befallen
them. Some day, no doubt, their now forgotten
works will be revived, just as those of neglected
poets and painters have been. Surely fame is to
some extent the accident of fortune. The case of
Sebastian Bach is the most striking illustration.
Of the majority of imitators or epigones, however,
it may briefly be written, as the abstract of the
historian’s page,—they lived—and died.</p>

<p class='c007'>We come now to the more recent and widely
celebrated composers, Raff, Brahms, Rubinstein,
Goldmark, Bruch and Rheinberger, who form the
subject of special articles in this work. These
masters are not to be classed with the new movement
inaugurated by Berlioz and Liszt in concert music
and by Wagner in the music-drama, but
with the “classical-romantic” masters. Raff, it is true,
wrote “program” music, but he differs from Berlioz
and Liszt in holding almost strictly to the regular
construction of the symphonic form. Though
Raff, in his earlier days, was a warm advocate of
the ideas of Wagner, his own music bears little
relation to the great works of the musical dramatist.
Raff has a style of his own. He never repeated
himself, notwithstanding the enormous amount of
music he composed. This fertility of ideas was in
fact a source of weakness, since it rendered him
careless in the choice of themes, and blunted his
feeling for what was truly refined and elevated. He
often failed to keep to the high level of the true
symphonic spirit and style. His “salon” style
crops out here and there. The “Lenore” and
“Im Walde” symphonies are his most celebrated
works.</p>

<p class='c007'>No living German composer represents the
tragic and intellectual side of modern subjective
music so impressively as Brahms. The strong outlines
of his character are impressed on all his
music. He is entirely opposed to the so-called
“new German school” of Liszt and Wagner, and
adheres strictly to the classical forms. No comparison,
however, ought to be made between him and
Wagner, as Brahms has never turned his attention
to dramatic music. Brahms defends his own art-principles
on the ground of absolute music. His love
for the strict, logical process of thematic development
proves his affinity with Bach. The leading theme
is the germ of the whole movement; and notwithstanding
the episodes and secondary themes, he
is not usually drawn away from the main idea.
Brahms has no living peer in the art of developing
themes; here he shows wonderful ingenuity and
infinite skill. In general, however, his themes do
not captivate us like the heaven-born melodies of
Schubert and Schumann. Strength, purity, nobility
and profundity of thought, rather than sensuous
beauty, grace, lightness, naturalness and spontaneousness,
are his leading characteristics as a composer.
A certain heaviness of spirit and gloom,
nay, asceticism, prevail in his music. He appears
at his best in his “German Requiem,” which many
musicians consider to be his greatest work. His
symphonies and other instrumental compositions
occupy the foreground at present. Although musicians
are still divided in opinion as to the ultimate
position of Brahms among the great masters, no
one can deny that his music is gaining public appreciation
year by year. He is universally recognized
as the foremost living composer of Germany.</p>

<p class='c007'>The so-called “musical reform,” inaugurated in
Germany more than a generation ago, was not incited
by Germans, but by the adopted composers,
Berlioz and Liszt. Their aim was simply to make
poetical ideas the motive and governing principle
of the form and material of their tone-works. The
idea of “program” music, however, was not original
with them; in fact, it is centuries old. Beethoven
was the first great master to write elaborate program
music; but his “Pastoral Symphony” was, in his own
words, “more expression of emotions than tone-painting.”
In this short statement of his faith he
has clearly defined the true scope of descriptive
music. He gave poetic titles to certain other
works, as, for instance, the “Heroic Symphony,” the
“Passionate” and “Farewell” sonatas, which serve to
indicate in a general way the poetical motive that
swayed his imagination. Spohr, Mendelssohn,
Schumann, Raff, Rubinstein and other later composers
have followed Beethoven’s example. Most
of the program music of these masters does not
modify the traditional form of musical construction.
Berlioz went much further, and conceived the idea
of using elaborate word descriptions to give a detailed
and minute exposition of his pseudo-symphonies.
Berlioz shot beyond his mark. Berlioz
made his program serve as a kind of running commentary
on the music. Liszt did not attempt this;
his aim was a simpler and a better one. Symphonic
Poem is the happy name for an original form which
he created in orchestral music. Some character or
event was chosen as a poetical motive easily realizable
in music; as, for instance, the Lament and
Triumph of Tasso, in which the passion and struggle
of the great poet are vividly portrayed, or the wild
ride of Mazeppa, which, as in Victor Hugo’s poem,
has a symbolical meaning. Mazeppa represents the
gifted man, or genius, tied down by fate, but destined
to free himself and ultimately to triumph over evil.
The galloping horse is suggested by wild triplets,
and the final triumph is expressed in the march
with which the work culminates.</p>

<p class='c007'>The symphonic poems of Liszt, and those who
follow strictly his example, are not divided into a
number of distinct, separate movements like the
symphony, but the changes of tempo or movement
follow each other without break. Liszt made a
prominent use of the Leitmotiv (leading-motive)
principle, which he adopted from Wagner. It will
be observed that the result, however, is wholly
different, for Wagner in the
course of one of his music-dramas
uses a variety of dissimilar
and strongly contrasted
leading motives. His music,
therefore, is based on the
<em>polythematic</em> principle, whereas
the symphonic poems of Liszt
are generally <em>monothematic</em>.
The leading-motive is one
thing in connection with the
drama, another as employed
in the concert-room. In the
latter case it serves the same
purpose that it has in the
fugues of Bach (mostly founded
on one theme) or in certain
movements of symphonies.
It is simply the working up
on the imitative principle of
a leading idea, which is modified,
enlarged, curtailed and
varied according to the conditions
of counterpoint, harmony,
rhythm, etc. So far as thematic imitation
is concerned, the symphonic poem is an offshoot
of the symphony or overture. What the
symphonic poem has gained in conciseness of form
it has lost in grandeur and impressiveness. The
symphonic poem relates to the symphony as a
noble and beautiful church does to a grand, awe-inspiring
cathedral. In treating his grandest subjects—“The
Divine Comedy” of Dante, and “Faust”
of Goethe—Liszt returned to the general outlines
of the symphony.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The symphonic poem is a welcome addition to
modern music, but it is capable of further development
both in form and character. There is no
reason why the polythematic principle should not be
applied to it, or why the movements should not
be extended. In the future the symphonic poem
may rival the symphony, but is not likely to supplant
it. The symphony has undergone many
changes of detail since Beethoven, and in the
course of time it is probable that new forms of
instrumental music will be invented, but it will be
difficult to reach as high an ideal as that attained
by the great masters of the symphony. In grandeur,
emotional intensity, thematic variety, contrast
of movements, the symphonies of Beethoven, Schubert,
Schumann, Brahms and
others stand on a higher plane
than the symphonic poems of
Liszt, Saint-Saëns and many
less conspicuous composers
who have cultivated this form.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would much exceed the
narrow limits set by this article
to attempt to discuss the far-reaching
questions connected
with the great musical and
dramatic reform of Wagner.
This forms the subject of an
able special article, to which
the reader is referred. Wagner’s
world-wide influence has
not been confined to the dramatic
stage. His bold independence
of thought and
creative originality served to
break down the barriers of
formalism and conservatism,
which held back German
music after the death of Mendelssohn
and Schumann. The Napoleon of music
cleared the way, not only for himself, but other
young composers who were struggling for recognition.
Since his death no German has yet appeared
able to follow in his footsteps, or to strike out a
path for himself in dramatic music. At the same time
all serious dramatic composers, Italian, French, etc.,
of the present day, have consciously or unconsciously
been affected by Wagner’s musico-dramatic ideas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among all the German composers who have
gathered inspiration from the theories and music
of Wagner, only a single one seems to have produced
a musical drama which bears the stamp of
real genius and clearly defined individuality.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Peter Cornelius (1824–74) first became prominent
at the time when Liszt at Weimar was doing
so much for the advancement of the so-called “new
German school of composition.” Cornelius at
once identified himself with this modern movement.
It was on account of the indifference of the court
and the public toward Cornelius’s “The Barber of
Bagdad” that Liszt gave up his directorship of the
theatre at Weimar in 1858. In the same year,
Cornelius’s opera, “The Cid,” was produced at
Weimar. The completion of a third opera, “Gunlöd,”
was prevented by his death, which occurred at
Mayence in 1874.</p>

<p class='c007'>His comic opera, “The Barber of Bagdad,”
gives Cornelius a unique position among the composers
of the new German school. This seems to
be the only work of genius which has been produced
in Germany as a result of the Wagnerian
cult; and it remains the single but the sufficient
ground for a denial of the charge made by disbelievers,
that the theories of Wagner can lead to
nothing beautiful and good in opera. The opera-poem
is by Cornelius himself, and is a marvel of
bubbling humor and literary ingenuity; and the
music is of exceeding complexity and intensely
difficult to render. The methods of treatment
are distinctly Wagnerian, but there is not a suggestion
of Wagner in the character of the melodies
or in the instrumentation. All is delightful and
individual, in short, the work of a genius. On the
other hand, in the “Cid,” a tragic opera founded
on Herder’s poem, Cornelius was not so successful.
It is certain that “The Barber” will ultimately be
appreciated; for its sparkling wit and delightful
music are irresistible, matched only among German
composers by the “Figaro” of Mozart.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cornelius was far from being a Wagner, but he
has done one thing which Wagner probably could not
have done: he has written an opera libretto which
is considered superlatively witty and entertaining
by other people than Germans, and set it to music
which is noble, charming and characteristic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Anton Bruckner has also been prominently identified
with the new German school. In his heavy
and massive instrumentation and style of writing he
is pronouncedly Wagnerian, but he has not endeared
himself to the lovers of sweet sounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another prominent disciple of Liszt and Wagner
is Felix Draeseke, born 1835, who became enthusiastic
for the new school, and contributed to the
literature devoted to the propagation of the ideas
of Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner. He was one of
the few who were openly praised by Wagner. His
numerous compositions consist of symphonies,
chamber music, songs and piano pieces. Draeseke
has written two operas, “Herrat” and
“Gundrun,” the latter of which has been performed
with success. Among his latest orchestral
productions are two symphonic preludes to dramas
by Calderon and Kleist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jean Louis Nicodé (born 1853) is another staunch
believer in the new tendencies in modern music.
His compositions for orchestra include “Symphonic
Variations,” the symphonic poem, “Maria Stuart,”
Suite in B minor, Introduction and Scherzo. He
has written piano and chamber music, and several
large choral works. His “Symphonic Variations”
are especially admired. Nicodé manifests the
most astounding technique in composition, and
delights in producing startling orchestral effects.</p>

<p class='c007'>Edward Lassen (born 1830), though a Dane by
birth, has been identified with music in Germany
for the greater part of his life. He was first made
known as a composer through the kind offices of
Liszt, who produced on the Weimar stage Lassen’s
“Le Roi Edgard,” “Frauenlob,” and “Der Gefangene.”
These operas met with a decided success.
Lassen succeeded Liszt as chief director of the
Weimar opera, and still holds that position. His
published works include the music to Hebbel’s
“Nibelungen,” Sophocles’ “Œdipus,” Calderon’s
“Circe,” and Goethe’s “Faust” and “Pandora,”
“Fest Cantate,” “Te Deum,” and several symphonies.
During the last few years he has occupied
himself principally with the composition of songs,
which are much admired. His latest work of importance
is his violin concerto.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_601'>601</span>Another worthy representative of the new German
music is Alexander
Ritter, the composer of
numerous vocal works,
including operas.
There is no doubt concerning
the seriousness
of his artistic endeavors,
nor of his great
abilities; but, as with
Nicodé, he has large
utterance, and but little
of real importance to
say.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>By far the most interesting
and the most
promising of this class
of modern composers
is Richard Strauss.
He is not related to
the Vienna Strauss
family. Young Strauss
is now Lassen’s assistant
director at the
Weimar theatre, and
has shown remarkable
ability both as an opera
and concert conductor.
Although not yet
thirty years old, he
has produced a considerable number of large
works and numerous smaller ones. His earlier
efforts show the influence of Brahms, but for the
last few years he has adopted the Wagner-Liszt
manner. Three symphonic poems, “Death and
Redemption,” “Macbeth” and “Don Juan,” as
well as a symphonic fantasia, “In Italy,” have been
greatly admired. Evidently this young composer
has a more promising future than any of his young
contemporaries.</p>

<p class='c007'>Felix Weingartner, the talented conductor of the
Royal Opera of Berlin, is a young composer of promise.
Besides numerous songs and a serenade for
string orchestra, he has written two operas. The
second of these, “Genesius,” was produced in
Berlin in November, 1892, but, as might have been
expected, it was not warmly received by the public.
Weingartner, like Strauss, is extremely modern in his
musical tendencies, and his works, although interesting
to connoisseurs and lauded by certain
critics, will not at once find public recognition.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would far exceed
the limits of this article
to give a complete
account of pianoforte
playing and composition
in Germany since
Beethoven’s time.
The influence of the
piano on modern music
has been greater than
that of any other single
instrument. It is not
only the favorite of the
amateur, but is <em>par
excellence</em> the composer’s
instrument.
As almost every modern
German composer
has written for the
piano, its literature is
far more voluminous
than that of any other
instrument, and piano
players are as countless
as the sands of the
sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>Modern representatives
of piano style may
be classed as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Composers with whom technical execution is
held subordinate to musical thought and feeling,
perfect form, and poetic beauty. Beethoven, Schubert,
Von Weber, Mendelssohn, Schumann, represent
this class.  2. Piano specialists who have
brought manual execution into the foreground and
have carried it to an extreme, chiefly for its own
sake; as for example, Kalkbrenner, Herz, Henselt,
Döhler, Thalberg, Dreyschock, Litolff and Liszt in
the earlier period of his career.  3. Remarkable
teachers of technique and style, like Czerny,
Moscheles, Kullak and Wieck. 4. Virtuosos who
unite great technique with remarkable powers of
interpretation, like Tausig, Von Bülow and others.
5. Composers who are likewise great virtuosos and
interpreters, like Liszt and Rubinstein.</p>

<p>FRANZ ABT.<br>  <br>  (See page <a href='#Page_597'>597</a>.)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Between 1830 and 1840 piano virtuosity as
regards mere technical execution was at its height.
Kalkbrenner, Herz, and other “finger knights” created
furore everywhere by their pyrotechnic feats.
This was the era of the “opera fantasia.” Let
us be thankful that audiences nowadays demand
a different kind of musical pabulum. Thalberg
(1812–71) marks the highest attainment of this
style. He was pre-eminent for his finished execution
and rich singing quality of tone. His scales,
octaves, arpeggios, trills, and every detail of technique
were of marvellous perfection. His style
influenced a number of pianists, as for example,
Leopold de Meyer, Goria, Döhler, Willmers and
Prudent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under Thalberg, Liszt, Tausig, Rubinstein,
Paderewski, etc., piano virtuosity has reached its
apex. Mr. Ernst Pauer, the noted pianist and
editor of “Alte Clavier Musik,” justly observes:
“With regard to rapidity, force, ingenuity of combinations,
and dazzling effect, it is not too much to
assert that the highest point has been gained, and
that with respect to <em>quantity</em> of notes and effects
our present players are unrivalled; whether the
<em>quality</em> is as good as it formerly was may be
questioned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The world-wide influence of Chopin and Liszt
on piano style is discussed in special articles of
this work.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the time of Bach and Handel the organ was
the foremost instrument as the exponent of musical
ideas even more than the pianoforte is during the
present century. To-day it has its own high place
in the temple of art, and counts among its devotees
artists of great repute and dignity. During the
present century German organists have followed the
school of Sebastian Bach, of whom the most prominent
are Rink, Johann Schneider, Hesse, Fischer,
Thiele, Haupt, Ritter, Becker, Merkel, Herzog,
Faisst and Rheinberger. August Haupt and Johann
Schneider were remarkable interpreters of
Bach’s organ works. The former was also a rare
teacher, beloved and venerated by his American
and German pupils. The most important organ
compositions of modern German masters are the
difficult and massive concert pieces of Thiele, and
the noble sonatas, etc., of Mendelssohn, Schumann,
Ritter, Merkel and Rheinberger.</p>

<p class='c007'>In solo violin playing Germany at first followed
the lead of Italy. Mention has been made of the
most noted German violinists of the last century.
About the beginning of the present century Paris
was the centre of violin playing under Viotti, Rode,
Kreutzer and Baillot. These masters laid down
the principles of violin playing as practised to-day.
They were followed by Alard, the modern French
teacher, and the so-called Belgian school of De
Beriot, Vieuxtemps, Wieniawski and others. As
regards finish, brilliancy of style, and purity of
tone these Franco-Belgian masters have had a strong
influence on Germany. In violin playing Spohr is
considered as the direct heir of Rode and Viotti.
The contemporaries of Spohr in Germany were
Schuppanzigh, Mayseder, Maurer, Molique, Lipinski
and others, all of whom contributed to violin
literature. Spohr’s most distinguished pupil was
Ferdinand David (1810–73). He was eclectic and
many-sided in his taste and knowledge. As regards
technique and style he set high value on the French
masters of the violin. He was the first to play
Bach’s difficult violin solos in public. Among his
numerous pupils was the famous virtuoso, Wilhelmj,
who is unsurpassed for his wonderful tone and
execution. Joachim also benefited by David’s
advice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The violin school, of Vienna, founded by Joseph
Boehm (1798–1876), has had a wide influence in
training virtuosos. Ernst, G. Helmesberger, Ludwig
Strauss, Joachim, J. Helmesberger, Auer and
Neruda were trained in this school. Pupils of
Pixis at Prague were the renowned violinists Kalliwoda
and Ferdinand Laub (1832–74). The latter
was a wonderful quartet player, and stood in the
front rank as a virtuoso.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joseph Joachim (born 1831) is the most eminent
of living violinists. He has had the widest influence
of any violin master as an interpreter of the
great masters. Perfect technique, a rich and full
tone, purity and elevation of style, and fidelity of
interpretation are the leading characteristics of
Joachim as a violinist. It may be said of Joachim,
as of Liszt, that he not only interprets but <em>recreates</em>
the music of the great masters. He is equally
great as a quartet player and as a soloist. Joachim’s
compositions are chiefly for the violin. His style
is grave and earnest, and suggestive of Schumann.
His most important work is the “Hungarian Concerto,”
which has noble characteristics.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most noted masters of the violoncello are
Bernhard Romberg (1767–1841), Kummer (1797–1879),
and his successor in the Dresden orchestra,
Grützmacher (born 1832), and the virtuoso composers,
Popper, Davidoff and De Swert.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Among the many fine solo players on wind instruments
were the renowned clarinetists, Joseph Baermann
(1784–1847) and his son Carl (1811–1885).
Von Weber was intimately associated with the elder
Baermann, and wrote for him the fine clarinet
concertos and concert pieces which have become
classical. The high artistic character and ability of
this family of musicians is exemplified in the
person of the thorough musician and gifted pianist,
Carl Baermann, Junior. He was formerly professor
at the Munich Royal Conservatory, and is now
a resident of Boston, where he exerts a noble influence
as concert pianist and teacher. Germany has
not produced so many singers of world-wide fame
as composers or virtuosos, yet during the last half-century,
and especially in connection with the Wagnerian
drama, the number of celebrated singers has
increased. As dramatic artists these German singers
are surpassed by none, though in pure vocalism
they may not rank as high as those of the Italian
and French school. Among the most renowned are
Sontag, Milder, Tichatschek, Pauline Lucca, Gerster,
Unger, Wachtel, Formes, Stockhausen, Staudigl,
Henschel, Wranitzky, Loewe and Schröder-Devrient
(1804–60). This last-named singer was
one of the most highly gifted artists who ever appeared
on the operatic stage. She created the part
of Leonore in Beethoven’s “Fidelio.” In later years
she appeared in Wagner’s earlier operas, and was of
great assistance to him in realizing his ideal of
dramatic singing. In his writings Wagner eulogizes
her. The musical dramas of Wagner have
not only been the high school for orchestral virtuosos
and conductors, but above all for dramatic
singers. The most famous German singers of the
present day have been associated with Bayreuth
and the established opera houses of Germany where
Wagner’s works are performed. The most noteworthy
of these Wagner singers are Frau Materna,
Marianne Brandt, Malten, Lehmann-Kalisch, Mallinger,
Dietz, Kindermann, Ludwig, Schnorr von Carolsfeld,
to whom Wagner pays such a tribute of
praise in the eighth volume of his collected writings;
Winkelmann, Vogl, Gura, Niemann, Scheidemantel,
Van Dyck, Alvary, Betz, Scaria and Emil Fischer.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the results of Germany’s high development
in music, and consequent “division of labor”
in the executive part of the art, has been to give
great importance to the conductors of orchestras
and of large musical societies. Until recently there
have been but few cases of really great conductors
who were not at the same time prominent composers.
Weber, Wagner, Spohr, Mendelssohn,
Marschner, Lindpaintner, Rietz and Hiller were all
Kapellmeister-composers. The remarkable advance
in orchestral technique and the increased
work demanded of conductors have given rise to
the necessity of training men exclusively for this
exacting profession. There are at present in Germany
a half-dozen specialists in this branch who
are particularly distinguished. Foremost among
them is the gifted Hans von Bülow (born 1830).
Great as are this master’s merits as a piano virtuoso,
it is chiefly as a conductor that he has had important
influence upon the musical activity of his
time. His long connection with the Meiningen
orchestra, at a period when it made frequent concert
tours through Germany, was of great service in
raising the standard of orchestral interpretation
throughout the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hans Richter (born 1843) also enjoys an international
reputation as a conductor. He is chief
conductor of the Imperial opera and Philharmonic
concerts of Vienna. He has also frequently conducted
the concerts of the London Philharmonic
Society. Richter was intimately associated with
Wagner, and directed the first Bayreuth performance
in 1876.</p>

<p class='c007'>A conductor of perhaps even greater ability, but
of less extended reputation, is Hermann Levi (born
1839), the chief conductor of the Munich theatre.
He also was intimately associated with Wagner, and
conducted the first performance of “Parsifal” at
Bayreuth in 1882. He is at present the conductor-in-chief
at Bayreuth. His principal claim to superiority
lies in the fact that he conducts equally well
the daintiest Haydn symphony and the most complex
Wagner music-drama. He is as a conductor
what Liszt was as a pianist, universally sympathetic
in his interpretations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Felix Mottl (born 1856) of Carlsruhe, and Ernst
Schuch (born 1848) of Dresden, are worthy to be
grouped with Germany’s great conductors. The
former is one of the Bayreuth conductors. The
young composers, Strauss and Weingartner, are also
able Kapellmeister.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any consideration of the history of music in
Germany would be incomplete without some mention
of her great achievements in musical criticism,
history, theory, philosophy and æsthetics. In
these departments of literary and scientific work,
Germany has accomplished infinitely more than
any other nation. We have already had occasion,
in speaking of certain composers, to mention their
literary works. But the majority of writers on
music have left no record as artists.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the eighteenth century the most noted
German writers on musical history and criticism
were Forkel, Gerbert, Mattheson, Scheibe, Reichardt
and J. A. Hiller; on musical theory and instruction,
Fux, Albrechtsberger, Marpurg, Kirnberger,
Sorge, Knecht, Quantz, Em. Bach and Leopold
Mozart. During the present century the principal
writers on the general subject of musical history
have been Brendel, von Dommer, Reissmann, Naumann,
Langhans and August Wilhelm Ambros
(1816–76). For original research, profound learning,
and remarkable critical insight the “Geschichte
der Musik” by Ambros ranks first among all works
on the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>R. G. Kiesewetter
(1773–1850),
the uncle of Ambros,
shows equal
thoroughness in
treating the special
subjects of musical
history. His monographs
on the Netherland
masters, on
secular song, on
Arabian music, etc.,
are sources of important
information.
Carl von
Winterfeld is the
great authority on
German church
music. His “Der
Evangelische Kirchengesang”
is a
work of great learning.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the field of
musical biography
the list is a long
one, and includes
Marx, Schindler,
Nohl, Nottebohm,
Lenz, Bitter, Chrysander, Jahn and Spitta.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Otto Jahn’s “Life of Mozart,” and Philipp
Spitta’s “Life of Bach,” are masterly biographies,
which are an honor to the authors and the nation
that produced them. They are monuments of
exhaustive research and profound critical analysis.
Mention should be made of the biography of Beethoven
by Alexander W. Thayer, which was published
in Germany as the fruits of many years of
patient and thorough investigation. The author is
an American by birth and education, but has long
been identified with German musical literature,
and is considered as the authority in all that pertains
to the life of the great composer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Musical criticism has been well represented by
Friedrich Rochlitz (1770–1808), the founder of the
“Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung” of Leipsic;
Adolf Bernhard Marx (1799–1866), one of the
most broadly educated musical writers of his time;
Gottfried Weber (1779–1839), editor of the musical
periodical, “Cæcilia”;
Thibaut,
whose “Purity in
Musical Art” is a
highly esteemed
essay; Schumann,
the composer, who
gave a new and
higher direction to
musical criticism
in his “Neue Zeitschrift
für Musik.”
Schumann’s gifted
poetical nature is
revealed in his critical
reviews as well
as in his music, and
he set an example
followed by others,
though at a distance,
among whom
Eduard Hanslick, of
Vienna, is perhaps
the most worthy of
mention; Wilhelm
Tappert, the editor
of the “Allgemeine
Deutsche Zeitung,”
is a zealous partisan
of Wagner.
His “Wagner Lexicon” is a curious compilation
of all the slang and abuse that have been hurled
at the composer and his friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the imaginative writers on musical subjects,
the most remarkable was Ernst T. R. Hoffmann,
whose romantic tales have given him a prominent
place in German literature. He was composer,
poet, singer, teacher, conductor and theatrical
manager; he was especially gifted as an improvisator.
Everything this eccentric genius did, he did
well. Among his works are eleven operas and two
symphonies. Schumann was much influenced by
the fantastic tales of Hoffmann. His “Kreisleriana”
was suggested by Hoffmann’s fragments of the imaginary
“Kreisler the Kapellmeister.” Beethoven
wrote a humorous canon addressed to Hoffmann,
and Weber loved him.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Germany, during the present century, has produced
almost endless works on musical theory and
speculation. The most prominent representatives
are G. Weber; Hauptmann, whose “Harmony
and Metre” is a profound work; Marx and Lobe,
whose general systems treat of all branches of musical
composition, including instrumentation, and are
valuable as books of reference; E. F. Richter and
Jadassohn, whose treatises on harmony, counterpoint
and fugue are excellent text-books. Other
well-known theoretical writers are Weitzmann, Paul,
Sechter, Riemann, Friedrich and Heinrich Bellermann
and Westphal.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The æsthetics of music have been extensively
treated by the foremost German philosophers.
Hegel and his followers Vischer and Kahlert, laid
the foundation of a comprehensive consideration of
the subject. The philosophers outside the Hegelian
school, Krüger, Schelling, Krause, Carriere,
Karl Köstlin, Fechner, Wundt and Lötze, have included
in larger works more or less extensive treatments
of musical æsthetics, and the interest which
Wagner felt for the theories of Schopenhauer is well
known. In addition to these, several writers—Schubart,
Hand, Schilling, Heinrich Köstlin, Reissmann,
Riemann, Kullak, Stumpf, Engel—have written large
treatises devoted exclusively to the subject. The
object has been to establish, if possible, the psychological
relations of music, and to deduce the <em>raison
d’être</em> of the various musical forms; but no one has
yet established conclusions which have been generally
accepted. Opposed to these writers are a small
number of advocates of a purely formalistic theory
of music,—Herbart, Zimmermann and Hanslick.
The last-named is the author of a book entitled
“Concerning the Musically Beautiful,” which has
been perhaps more generally read and commented
upon than any other single work on musical æsthetics.
It is safe to assert that this work of Hanslick
does not solve the mystery of the power of
music on the soul. Certainly it seems to be a
superficial idea of Hanslick that music has no inward
meaning (or Inhalt), and is only a mere play
of form (Formspiel). But this interesting little
book is so brilliantly written and so carefully considered
that it still holds its own, and is known
throughout the musical world.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this connection mention should be made of
“The Sensations of Tone,” published in 1863 by
Hermann Helmholtz, the great Berlin physicist.
This work is not only one of the greatest achievements
of German science, but is also unique
among all works published on the subject of music.
It embodies the results of exhaustive research
into all phenomena connected with the production
of tone and its perception by the human consciousness.
In a word, it establishes a firm physical
foundation for all future philosophical speculations
concerning music.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is commonly and truly said that the time is
not yet ripe for an exhaustive history of music.
An enormous amount of material, it is true, has
been collected, but in most divisions of the subject
the sources of information have not yet been
thoroughly explored. At present Germany is distancing
all other nations in the contributions made
to the sum of historical knowledge concerning
music. Not to mention the numberless treatises
and monographs which are continually appearing,
the regularly published musical periodicals are numerous
and excellent, and frequently make important
contributions to musical scholarship.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the present article is far from professing
to present a complete account of all that
Germany has accomplished in music, it may serve
to show the many-sided character of musical culture
in that land. Not one of the many branches of
musical activity has failed to feel the influence of
Germany, and in only a few branches does she
hold any other than the leading position. In our
own day her musical zeal remains unabated. The
number of musical compositions and books published
year by year in Germany is enormous, and
the proportion of her young men who enter on the
career of teacher or performer seems to be increasing
rather than diminishing. While it is true
that there are very few great composers now living
in Germany, and that they are rivalled by the living
composers of other nationalities, and even though
in the latest music of over-cultivated Germany
there is a want of freshness, naturalness and
<em>naïveté</em> that belong only to musical youth, yet
there is no reason for supposing that any other
nation will, in the near future, usurp Germany’s
well-merited title of “laureate amongst all musical
nations.”</p>

Lully is justly considered the
founder of opera in France, although
he was not the first to
compose operas in the French
language. Several of his biographers
assure us that he was of
noble birth, supporting their statements by the letters
of naturalization granted him by Louis XIV., in
December, 1661, in which the composer is called
the son of Laurent Lully, a man of quality, and
Catherine del Sarte. It is, however, more probable
that he was the offspring of an obscure country
miller who dwelt near Florence, as stated by Guichard
in a celebrated memoir which he drew up
at the time of his lawsuit for dissolution of partnership
with Lully, who had co-operated with him
in the management of the Opéra.</p>

<p class='c007'>By chance it came to pass that the Chevalier de
Guise, when travelling in Italy, discovered young
Baptiste Lully in Florence, his native place. The
nobleman was impressed by the precocious intelligence
that sparkled so brightly in the boy’s eyes.
He who was destined to become the founder of
lyric tragedy in France was singing popular songs,
accompanying himself upon the guitar, from instinct
rather than training, for he had never been taught
to play that instrument, and possessed, as yet, only
the most primitive ideas regarding music. He
was then about twelve years of age.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that time, people were not very musical in
France, Italy being much more advanced in that
respect. In the era of Le Grande Monarque,
“Le Roi Soleil,” there were neither orchestras nor
singers in the true sense of the words, and opera
was, so to speak, quite unknown.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first musical play ever seen in France was
produced on the occasion of the marriage of Mlle.
de Vaudemont, Marguerite de Lorraine, sister-in-law
of King Henri III., to the Duc de Joyeuse.
It was performed on the 15th of October, 1579, at
the Château de Moustier, in presence of ten thousand
spectators, and the Italian, Baltazarini, fulfilled
the duties of impressario. He was ever afterwards
known by the name of Baltazar de Beaujoyeuse,
and in this way the Duc de Joyeuse may be said
to have ennobled him.</p>

<p class='c007'>This Italian had been brought to France by the
Comte de Brissac, and Catherine de Médicis appointed
him musical director, with the dignity of
valet, to her court. He played the violin after
the manner of a virtuoso—for his time. It was
this same Baltazarini who composed the dance
music in the opera-ballet “Cérès,” of which Claudin
wrote the vocal score.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cardinal Mazarin was fond of musical plays, and
in 1644 he caused to be brought from Italy dramatic
singers who, in the hall of the Petit-Bourbon and in
presence of the king, Louis XIV., gave a representation
of the “Festa della finta pazza,” a melodrama
in five acts interspersed with comic interludes.
Two years later, the Abbé Mailly organized a representation
of a lyric tragedy entitled “Akebar, Roi
du Mogol,” which was given in one of the halls of
the episcopal palace of Carpentras.</p>

<p class='c007'>The taste for music was gradually extending in
the ranks of cultivated French society, and Mlle.
de Montpensier had asked the Chevalier de Guise
to bring for her from Italy—the cradle of opera—“a
young musician to enliven my house.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you come with me to Paris?” asked the
Chevalier, addressing the little singer and guitarist:
to which the lad, without a moment’s hesitation,
and as if impelled by his destiny, joyfully answered,
“Yes.” Thereupon the twain set out for the French
capital, and the Chevalier <em>gave</em> his Italian musician
to “Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The grand-daughter of Henri IV. received Baptiste
as she would have received a pug dog,—an
animal then very fashionable. For a few days she
amused herself with her little musician, then wearily
cast him aside, finally relegating him to her kitchens,
where he was enrolled among the scullions. It was
thus that the nobility and clergy of that day were
wont to treat musicians, great and small. It must
not be forgotten that the Archbishop of Salzburg,
who kept the divine Mozart in his service for a
certain time, made him wear livery and sent him to
take his meals in the kitchen with the servants.</p>

<p class='c007'>While washing the dishes or stirring the kitchen
fire, and possibly while tasting the sauces, unknown
to the <em>chef</em>, the little Florentine lifted up his voice
in song. In his spare time he played the guitar or
practised the violin, upon which instrument he is
said to have become an accomplished player.</p>

<p class='c007'>Occasionally he was given verses, which he set to
music with great facility. To Lully is attributed
the air which became so popular and which is still
sung, more particularly in the country districts, to
the words “Au clair de la lune, mon ami Pierrot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>One day were sent to him some couplets that
were far from laudatory of the proud princess, his
mistress. The verses greatly diverted Baptiste, who
composed a pretty air to the words, and sang it to
every one. This afforded much amusement in the
kitchen of haughty “Mademoiselle,” who, hearing
of the insult, caused her audacious and disrespectful
scullion-composer to be expelled from her house.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his secret heart, the great musician, that was
to be, felt glad when thus disgraced. He was free;
penniless, it is true, but courageous and full of
hope in the future. He began to study harmony
under Gigault, the organist of St. Nicolas-des-Champs,
and ultimately succeeded in gaining admittance
to the Grande Bande des Violons du
Roi, which consisted of forty performers. Some
few airs which he wrote for the violin were favorably
received and rendered in the presence of the Le
Grande Monarque himself. His Majesty was, indeed,
so pleased with the young artist (Lully was
then nineteen), that he appointed him Inspector
of the violins. And this was not all, for the king
organized for Lully’s satisfaction another band of
musicians, called Les Petits Violons, in order to
distinguish them from the “Grande Bande.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From that moment a brilliant future awaited the
composer. His agreeable manners, docile spirit,
and a certain wild audacity, that did not diminish
his profound deference for his benefactor, the king,
won and retained the royal favor; genius did the
rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little band of violinists, thanks to their skilful
training under the direction of Lully, achieved
wonders, far outstripping the original band in
regard to both time and accuracy of execution.</p>

<p class='c007'>Being now in high favor at court, Lully was
authorized to compose dance tunes for the ballets
that Louis XIV. caused to be performed nearly
every year, and in which his Majesty himself
participated. Later he composed the entire musical
portion of these entertainments, which were
sometimes called “Mascarades.” He was uniformly
successful, and Fortune had evidently
chosen him for her own.</p>

<p class='c007'>Enterprising and full of confidence in his talent
and <em>savoir-faire</em>, Lully, having formed a friendship
with Molière, did not hesitate to appear as a comedian
and to perform in the pieces that were represented
in the great dramatist’s theatre. In 1669,
he took the <em>rôle</em> of Pourceaugnac in the piece of
that name, and the Mufti in “Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Certain writers, contemporaries of Lully, foremost
among whom must be mentioned the great
Racine and the no less illustrious La Fontaine,
have passed a somewhat harsh judgment on the
composer’s character. It is true that he sometimes
showed himself a most abject sycophant in presence
of the nobility at court, and especially before the
king. But what courtier was not humble in presence
of the sovereign of that court? Still, in spite
of his humility before the great, Lully did not completely
lose his dignity. On certain occasions his
retorts to influential persons at court, and even to
the king himself, were characterized by remarkable
boldness. Two examples may be given to show
the droll and daring humor of the celebrated
composer.</p>

<p class='c007'>It happened, one day, that the Marquis de Louvois,
the powerful minister of Louis XIV., taunted
Lully with having secured the king’s friendship
solely by his talent for buffoonery. To this the
musician, drawing up his head proudly, made the
fearless reply, “Zounds! you would do as much if
you could!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, at the first performance of “Armide” at
Versailles, Félix Clément tells us, some unforeseen
difficulties prevented the raising of the curtain at
the appointed time. The king, becoming impatient
at the delay, sent one of the officers of his
guard to inform Lully of his dissatisfaction. The
words, “The king is waiting,” elicited from the
composer a reply as sharp as it was wanting in
respect. “The king,” said he, “is master here,
and nobody has the right to prevent him waiting
as long as he likes!”—a quip more witty than
prudent. The courtiers believed that the man who
dared to make such a reply was irretrievably lost;
and when “Armide” was given at the Royal Academy
of Music on the 15th of February, 1686, the
audience, fearful of compromising themselves if
they applauded the work, received it in a depressingly
frigid manner. Convinced of the merit of
his score, Lully had it executed a few days later
for his own satisfaction (as did the king of Bavaria,
recently, with Wagner’s lyric dramas at the theatre
of Bayreuth). Louis XIV. hearing of this, and
feeling that a work which had been pronounced
good by <em>his</em> musician could not be otherwise, set
the seal of his praise on the score of “Armide,”
which immediately obtained a signal success and
was even proclaimed the best work that Lully had
written.</p>

<p>JEAN BAPTISTE LULLY.<br>  <br>  From an engraving by Bonnart at the British Museum.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It has also been said that the founder of French
opera, though humble and abject in the presence
of the powerful, was proportionately insolent and
despotic with his artists and the persons employed
at the Opéra. It is true that Lully often flew into
a passion and accused the performers of clumsiness,
and he went so far, on one occasion, as to
break the violin belonging to one of the members
of the orchestra upon the head of the unfortunate
performer, because he had failed to render a somewhat
difficult passage in a satisfactory manner. The
composer made amends for his violence, however,
by presenting to the insulted violinist three times
the value of the broken instrument, and also by
inviting him to dinner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Apart from the acts he committed in moments of
passion, Lully was a model director and far outshone
any who preceded him. He found time to
do everything; he composed, attended the court,
saw to the <em>mise-en-scène</em> of his operas, and
superintended the rehearsals of both the vocal
and instrumental elements of the piece. He paid
great attention to the scenic effects, which were
very complicated in that day, and being a clever
comedian and an accomplished dancer, he acted
as stage manager and general director of all
dramatic performances.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lully married the daughter of Lambert, who is
mentioned by Boileau in his third satire; and their
union was a happy one. In the course of time the
composer became wealthy, and the owner of several
houses in Paris. His death was brought about by
a curious accident. Louis XIV. having been ill,
on his recovery, Lully composed, as a thanks-offering,
a “Te Deum” which was performed under his
direction at the Feuillants in the Rue Saint-Honoré,
on the 8th of February, 1687. During
one of the rehearsals Lully was beating time with
his cane, and, in so doing, accidentally struck his
toe, inflicting a bruise. The injury, which seemed
at first nothing more than a slight concussion,
speedily developed into a serious sore; an abscess
appeared, and of such a malignant character that
the doctors considered it would be necessary to amputate
the affected part. Lully hesitated to sanction
this extreme step, and in a short time it became
a question, not of amputating merely the toe,
but the entire foot. The patient would not consent
to this, however, and the disease, making rapid
progress, soon affected the whole leg, and the one
hope of saving his life lay in the amputation of that
member. Unfortunately, at the very moment when
he appeared willing to undergo the operation, a
quack came on the scene and offered to cure the
patient without recourse to amputation; but the
efforts of this empirical pretender were in vain, and
the illustrious composer passed away at Paris, on
Saturday, the 22d of March, 1687, aged fifty-four
years. Of him Mme. de Sévigné wrote, after
listening to some of his more serious music, “If
there be music in heaven, it must be the music of
Lully.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The distinguishing qualities of Lully’s dramatic
music are nobility of style, correct declamation,
and truth of sentiment, dramatic and scenic.
Most of the ornate effects in vocal music which
were then fashionable in Italy were excluded from
French opera by Lully.</p>

<p class='c007'>In “Alceste,” a lyric tragedy in five acts, with
prologue, the words by Quinault, Lully’s third work,
performed in the month of January, 1674, we find
the celebrated air sung by Charon. It is a veritable
masterpiece of lyric declamation, and is still
frequently sung and has not become old-fashioned,
for it embodies that supreme quality that knows no
date, human sentiment voiced in a truthful manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cadmus et Hermione” was the first great work
produced by Lully. The master had just taken
possession of the Palais-Royal hall, as director of
the Opéra, by royal favor, and it was with this
piece that he inaugurated his control. So far, the
composer had written only interludes, interspersed
with songs and dance music, among which the
most important were those written for pieces by
Molière, “Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme,” “La Princesse
d’Elide,” “Le Mariage Forcé,” “L’Amour
Médecin,” “Monsieur de Pourceaugnac,” and
“Psyché.” He had also written, prior to his brilliant
<em>début</em> as a dramatic composer, the music for
the ballets “La Raillerie,” “Le Ballet des Muses,”
“Cariselli,” “Les Amours Déguisés,” and several
others.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before his first tragic work, Lully had produced
the pasticcio, composed of airs borrowed from his
own <em>répertoire</em>, “Les Fêtes de l’Amour et de Bacchus,”
a pastoral in three acts for which Molière,
Benserade, and Quinault wrote the words. The
composer, ever fortunate, had the pleasure of seeing,
at a performance at which the king was present,
the Duke of Monmouth, the Duc de Villeroy,
and the Marquis de Rassen dance in this pastoral;
for, with a view to acquire graceful deportment,
they were content to mix with professional dancers.
This fact is significant of the manners of society
during that period in the history of France, and the
applause bestowed by Louis
XIV. upon the noble dancers,
also redounded to
the credit of Lully and
contributed to his promotion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Atys” was a particularly
fortunate piece, for it
gave especial pleasure to
Le Grande Monarque,
who might have said, without
undue exaggeration,
“La France, c’est moi!”
This work, on which Quinault
collaborated, was produced
for the first time
at the Château of St. Germain,
in the month of January,
1678, in the presence
of Louis XIV., and was
not brought to the notice
of the Parisians before the
month of August of the
following year. “Atys” was therefore called the
“Opéra du Roy.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The first performance of this lyric tragedy at
St. Germain was made especially attractive because
the dances were executed by lords and ladies of
the court, in conjunction with the ordinary dancers
of the Royal Academy of Music. Many of the
morceaux in “Atys” are worthy of mention. The
critics of the time have greatly eulogized the air
“Le Sommeil” in the third act, on account of the
persistence of the rhythm in the bass (four quarter
notes).</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as “Atys” was called the “King’s Opera,”
so “Isis” received the name of the “Musicians’
Opera.” A music critic of the times writes as follows
concerning the work: “This opera is the most
erudite ever written by Lully, who spent an infinite
time upon it. At the court performance, the great
number of instruments, played by the most accomplished
masters, contributed not a little to emphasize
the beauties of the music.”</p>

<p class='c007'>M. de Lajarte, formerly the librarian of the Opéra
library, and one of the principal collaborators of the
publisher, Michaelis, of Paris, has recently realized
the happy idea of reconstituting and condensing,
with piano accompaniment, the masterpieces of the
French opera of the seventeenth century, and he
makes the following interesting
remark respecting
this “great number” of instruments:
“The extraordinary
number spoken of
by Fresneuse dwindles
down to trumpets in the
prologue, and flutes at the
end of the third act. But,
by a happy coincidence,
these two symphonic members
of the work which so
astonished our forefathers
are also a subject of astonishment
for us modern
critics, at least in the matter
of the trumpets. The
degree of skill and certainty
in tonguing displayed by
the trumpet players in
Lully’s orchestra was nothing
short of marvellous.”
The trumpet parts in the
works of Bach and Handel are not less difficult of
execution, and at this day it would seem that they
could not possibly be played.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now that the music known as imitative has made
such notable progress, frequently exceeding the
limits of good taste, now that Meyerbeer, Berlioz,
and, above all, Wagner have carried to such perfection
the complicated art of orchestration, it is
very interesting to read in the score of “Isis” the
air imitative of the noises in nature and called the
“air de Pan.” It enables us to realize the extraordinary
progress made in instrumentation since
Lully’s time. This air was exceedingly popular at
that day. In addition to the sounds heard in
nature, which are not made very prominent, however,
this page of music is rich in declamation, and
is not without charm. But sweeter to the ear, in
our opinion, is the duet of nymphs in the second
act. It is simple, clear, and remarkably graceful.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be readily understood that the limits of
this biography will not admit of an exhaustive criticism
of Lully’s works. We can only point out, in a
somewhat cursory manner, the finest passages of
his better-known operas, “Psyché,” “Bellerophon,”
“Proserpine,” “Armide,” etc. In “Bellerophon”
one is fain to quote the entire prologue, in order to
show the <em>ideas</em>, the <em>subjects</em>, or, to put it in another
way, the mere melody. This grand spectacular
lyric tragedy was performed with great success during
ten consecutive months, and it was afterward
reproduced several times.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Phaéton”—for some inexplicable cause—has
been called the “people’s opera,” just as “Armide”
has been styled the “women’s opera.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lully’s “Armide,” although much inferior to the
“Armide” of Gluck, must nevertheless be included
among his works best adapted for the stage, and
the most concentrated in style. Only eight years
before the appearance of Gluck’s immortal “Armide,”
that is to say, in 1764, the Academy of
Music performed the opera of the same name by
Lully for the last time, and with brilliant success.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Persée” is, without doubt, one of Lully’s finest
works. The score abounds with charming morceaux,
the product of a skilled and fertile pen. This
opera held its place for long in the <em>répertoire</em>, and
each time it was revived the public accorded it a
favorable reception. The libretto, by Quinault,
the faithful collaborator of the musician, is written
in a superior style, offering excellent situations for
the musician. Nor should we forget to mention
“Proserpine,” Lully’s tenth opera in order of
representation.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already observed that the distinguishing
trait of the dramatic music of Lully, as compared
with his contemporaries, is pre-eminently the
grandeur of his style, with a declamation so exact
that it may be described as perfect. His music is
the embodiment of the art of moderation in the
recitative, and the accessories of song so lavishly
employed by nearly all the Italian composers of the
seventeenth century are not permitted by him to
overwhelm the essential note of the melody. Lully
shows less variety, less flexibility in the ensemble
of his productions, than do Carissimi, Léo, Pergolèse,
and Marcello, but he comes nearer dramatic
truth than any of these masters. His music, for
the most part, has the killing frost of age upon it;
but that he was a man of genius is scarcely in
need of demonstration. He was an innovator, as
surely as was Gluck, and, moreover, was an epoch-maker
in operatic music. As a musician he was
not without learning, as an examination of his overtures
will clearly evidence. Some charming pieces
for the clavecin show him as a pleasing and skilful
writer for that instrument. The student can still
find much in Lully’s scores that will repay thoughtful
attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>The name of Lully is inseparable from that of his
faithful collaborator, Quinault, the versatile and
imaginative poet who aided the composer by providing
him subjects which were not only suited to the
taste of the time, but contained situations adapted
for the purposes of the musician. Before all and
beyond all, Quinault, who in no wise deserved the
bitter satires that Boileau showered upon him,
thoroughly understood the genius of Lully, and
knew how to adapt that genius to the tragedies
which he was thereby inspired to write.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be understood why we do not give a facsimile
reproduction of Lully’s musical manuscript,
when we say that neither in the musical library of
the Opéra, nor in that of the Conservatoire, nor at
the National Library of Paris, nor anywhere else,
can a single note of music from the pen of the
founder of French opera be discovered. The same
is true of his handwriting, not a line of which has
come down to us. All that remains of it are three
signatures. The composer of the music of “Le
Bourgeois Gentilhomme” has this in common
with its author, Molière, of whose writing only two
or three signatures are extant.</p>

Just as Lully was the glory of the
seventeenth century, so French
musical genius is represented in
the eighteenth by Rameau, the
most learned theorist and illustrious
composer of his time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jean Philippe Rameau was born at Dijon on the
25th of September, 1683. His father and mother
were amateur musicians, and they carefully taught
their son the elements of the art of which he was
destined to become such a celebrated master. The
little Rameau made very rapid progress, and his
numerous biographers are agreed that at the age of
seven there was no musical score which he could
not execute at sight on the harpsichord.</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of his extraordinary talent for music,
Rameau’s parents did not wish him to become an
artist. They desired that he should enter the
magistracy, and placed him as a student in the care
of the Jesuits. He did not make much progress,
however, and did not get beyond the fourth class in
Latin; for his head was full of music and he could
not apply himself to study, insomuch that he became
a deplorable example for his school-fellows.
His copy-books were annotated with fragments of
music which passed through his mind and which he
took a great pleasure in putting upon paper. He
was at last sent away from the Jesuit college as an
intractable pupil; he had but a very slight knowledge
of Latin, French, or history, and the same might
be said of other subjects.</p>

<p class='c007'>On returning to his family he gave himself up
completely to the study of the harpsichord and the
organ, and also learned to play upon the violin. As
regards harmony, the youthful Rameau failed to get
beyond the first principles of that art-science, as he
could not find in Dijon any musician sufficiently
well informed on the rules and practice of counterpoint
to perfect his knowledge of harmony. Who
knows whether it was not precisely this unfortunate
blank in his studies which caused him later on to
undertake the theoretical inquiries into the formation
of chords that are the subject of his admirable
treatises on harmony?</p>

<p class='c007'>Before he had thoroughly learned the laws of harmony,
Rameau, as yet a beardless youth, yielded to
the law laid down by the little winged god whose
name is Cupid. He fell madly in love with a
widow who was his neighbor. Everybody knows
that nothing exercises a more unfortunate or more
beneficial influence over the mind of a young lover
than the advice given him by the woman he loves.
Happily the widow gave good advice to her
adorer. She went so far one day as to reproach
him with his ignorance of the French language.
“You spell like a scullion!” she told him. Rameau
did not die on the spot in consequence of this
outrage, for he was a strong-minded youth; but his
face became scarlet, and he promised to study—a
promise he kept.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rameau’s father, however, who desired to put an
end to the intrigue carried on by his son—who
was as precocious in passionate gallantry as he was
talented on the harpsichord—broke off the liaison
by sending him to travel in Italy. Rameau did not
tear himself away from his fair neighbor without
great emotion, his heart beating <em>prestissimo appassionato</em>;
but he was bound to obey the paternal behest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The future author of “Castor and Pollux” was not
yet eighteen years of age when he arrived in Milan.
The works of the Italian composers then in vogue
did not at all modify his taste, which was entirely
the outcome of his own peculiar character. He
heard the music of Scarlatti, Lotti, Duni, Caldara,
Leo, and it caused him surprise rather than satisfaction.
He remained but a short time in the capital
of Lombardy, and did not continue his Italian excursion
further than that point. He had but one
desire, and that was to return to France. Chance
having brought him into contact with a theatrical
manager, who had come to Milan to get together
an orchestra and an operatic troupe for a tour in the
south of France, Rameau accepted an engagement
as violinist. It was several years later when he returned
to Dijon. Whether or not he sought the
widow for whom he had felt such an affection
history does not say. We are rather inclined to
think that he did not see her again, as he remained
at Dijon but a very short time. Henceforth, he
patiently awaited the moment when he should be
able to go to Paris, to sit at the feet of eminent masters
who would perfect him in the art of composition.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally he left for the French capital, and arrived
there in the course of the year 1717, being then
about thirty-four years of age. It was very late to
commence the study of an art of which he as yet only
imperfectly understood the technique. Especially
was it late to dream of attaining celebrity in theatrical
music, access to which was always very difficult
for unknown composers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rameau at last believed that he had found a
protector and a professor who would be disposed to
complete his musical education, in the person of
the organist Marchand, who was held in great esteem
in Paris. But Marchand at once detected the
superior genius—although it was then in a latent
state—of the Dijon musician, and under the influence
of fear and jealousy he sent him away. He
acted indeed in a most culpable manner towards
Rameau and showed unjust partiality to others, as
we shall see.</p>

<p class='c007'>The position of organist at the Church of St. Paul
becoming vacant, it was submitted to public competition.
Rameau, being obliged to work to keep
the pot boiling, presented himself as a competitor
against one Daquin, who was an indifferent
organist, and still more indifferent composer.
Marchand was appointed judge of the competition.
According to the testimony of all who
were present at this interesting trial, Rameau stood
forth immensely superior to Daquin. Nevertheless
Marchand decided in favor of the latter, and consequently
the position was given to him. After this
check, Rameau was obliged to accept a place as
organist at Lille. He left Paris regretfully; but his
departure was a source of great satisfaction to Marchand,
who feared his presence there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rameau did not remain long at Lille. He had a
brother at Clermont, in Auvergne, who was a musician
of some talent, and organist of the cathedral of
that city. Wishing to retire, he offered Jean Philippe
the position which he was leaving, and the
place being a remunerative one, Rameau accepted.
He was, however, to his deep regret, obliged to
enter into an engagement for a certain number of
years, for towards Paris his eyes were ever turned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Situated in the midst of the mountains, the town
of Clermont was at that time very little visited by
strangers, and Rameau concentrated himself in his
own personality. He wrote motets and pieces for
the harpsichord. There, too, he reflected upon the
natural laws governing the formation of chords, the
theory of which had not then been expounded.
After deep and continuous study—like Newton
when he discovered the law of gravitation—Rameau
at last discovered the secret of harmony. To
him belongs the glory of being the first to formulate
these laws, in his first work, of which we shall speak
presently.</p>

<p class='c007'>Four years had passed away, yet Rameau was
bound to remain at Clermont for several years
more, in accordance with the terms of his agreement;
but he still saw Paris in his dreams, Paris,
the only city where he could produce his compositions
and his book on theory. He was, however,
held in great esteem at Clermont, and in spite
of his repeated attempts to cancel the agreement
he was unable to do so. He then devised a
plan by which he should be sent away from his
church for reasons contrary to those which were
advanced by the friends and admirers who desired
him to remain there. They thought that he was an
inspired organist and that his harmonies were of an
elevated and powerful character. Rameau suddenly
began to play on his noble instrument like an ignorant
musician, destitute of ideas, bringing forth such
discordant and frightful sounds that the clergy were
scandalized and the faithful stopped their ears. Remonstrances
were made to him. He answered that
he could do no better; that it was in this wise that
the noble art of the organist had been suddenly revealed
to him, and that he should always play in this
manner. He was accordingly dismissed and received
his discharge with infinite joy. At the last
service which he attended, when his successor sat
by his side, he ceased his practical joking and
played upon the organ in such a manner as to compel
the admiration of all who heard it. He was
determined that they should regret his departure,
and he succeeded marvellously.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus Rameau returned to Paris, where, in the
course of a short time, he published his
treatise on harmony. But the subject was
so novel and the explanations given by the
author so abstruse that musicians failed to
understand it. This, however, did not prevent
them from speaking of it malevolently,
with the naive and base assurance born
of ignorance and vanity. Profoundly saddened
but not discouraged by this result,
he turned to composition for the renown
which was not accorded to him as a theorist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rameau wrote with rare facility cantatas
with choruses, sonatas, and other
pieces for the harpsichord, which caused
him to be regarded with great interest by
the public. Pupils came to him and he
obtained the position of organist at the
church of Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie.
He would have been perfectly happy in
this position, had he not yearned for a
grander destiny, of which mention has already
been made—success as a composer
of grand opera.</p>

<p class='c007'>To test his strength he made his debut
in a small theatre, as the author of the
scores for several pieces written by his
fellow-Dijonais, the poet Piron, of happy
memory, with songs and dance-tunes,
which did not pass unnoticed. Then, resuming
his labors on musical theory, he published
his second book on the subject. This book, like
the first, did not escape the malevolent criticism
of ignorant persons; but this tended to spread
abroad the name of the author, which came to be
talked of in spite of the efforts made to keep it
secret. Rameau’s instrumental music began to be
sought after, and his pieces for the harpsichord were
played everywhere. This result was not what he had
hoped to attain: conscious of his superiority as a dramatic
composer, his goal, as we know, was the Académie
de Musique. He applied to the echoes of
the neighborhood, that is to say, to all the lyric poets
who had a reputation. These turned a deaf ear to
his request, being fearful of collaborating at the debut
(always an uncertain matter) of a composer in
so difficult, so complex an art as lyric tragedy.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At last, however, Rameau found the golden key
which, so the proverb says, opens every door, even
the door of the Opera, in the person of the great
financier, M. de la Popelinière, whose wife was one of
his pupils and took lessons on the harpsichord. M.
de la Popelinière arranged a meeting at his house
between the most illustrious Voltaire and Rameau,
the humble aspirant to musical glory. Voltaire promised
to write an opera for the protégé of the great
Farmer-General, and this piece appears in the complete
works of Voltaire under the title of “Samson.”
The literary masterpiece of the great writer pleased
Rameau greatly, and he set to work upon the
accompanying music with great enthusiasm. When
the score was finished the musician rendered it
at de la Popelinière’s house, in presence of Voltaire
and a chosen few. Rameau emerged from the
ordeal triumphant; but, alas! there’s many a slip
’twixt cup and lip. The director of the Académie
de Musique would have nothing to do with the
piece, which he considered unsuitable for the opera,
because founded on a biblical subject. It is interesting
to remember what Voltaire has written on
this question.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rameau,” says he, in speaking of “Samson,”
“Rameau, the greatest musician in France, set this
opera to music about the year 1732. It was about
to be produced, when the same cabal which at a
later date succeeded in causing the representations
of ‘Mahomet’ (one of Voltaire’s tragedies)
to be suspended, prevented the production of
‘Samson’ at the Opéra.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I do not know whether
the cabal spoken of by
the author of the “Dictionnaire
Philosophique” was
responsible in this matter.
I should be inclined to
think that the director of
the Opéra simply took
counsel with himself.
Whatever the fact, Voltaire
adds:</p>

<p class='c007'>“And at the very time
when permission was given
for this piece (“Samson”)
to be played at the Theatre
of the Comédie Italienne,
and when ‘Samson’
worked miracles conjointly
with Arlequin, permission
was not granted for the
same subject to be represented
in a noble and
worthy manner at the Theatre
of the Académie de
Musique. Our musician has since made use of
nearly all the airs in ‘Samson’ in other lyric compositions,
which envy was unable to suppress.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is quite true that Rameau utilized, but long
afterwards, a part of the music in “Samson” for his
opera “Zoroastre.” This work was not his début at
the opera. The composer appeared before the
Académie de Musique with “Hippolyte et Aricie,”
by the Abbé Pellegrin, a worldly abbé if there ever
was one, and a great playwright, concerning whom
these verses were written:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">Il dîne de l’autel et soupe du théâtre.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>M. de la Popelinière advanced 500 livres to the
Abbé to secure him against the possible failure of
the piece, and Rameau set to work again. This
opera was given on the first of October, 1733. The
composer attained renown in his fiftieth year: he
was old in years but young in fame, as we have seen.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Before examining the dramatic works of Rameau
and forming an opinion as to their influence upon
French art, we will add a few words concerning
the composer’s personal
appearance. He was tall
in stature and extraordinarily
thin. His face was
furrowed by deep wrinkles;
he had an aquiline nose,
a broad and open forehead
and prominent cheek-bones.
The mouth was
large, the look frank and
bold and indicative of
energy, perseverance and
will power. One might
have supposed him a person
of delicate health, although
he was never seriously
ill, owing to the very
sober regime which he had
adopted. Given much to
reflection, he was not talkative
and never spoke of
himself. He married a
young lady named Marie
Louise Mangot, who was a
good musician and had a
very fine voice, and she made her illustrious husband
very happy in his home circle by her amiable
character and her kindness of heart. He had by
her three children, one son and two daughters.
Rameau died at the age of about eighty-one, in
the same month as that which saw his birth—the
12th of September, 1764—leaving behind him
a considerable quantity of dramatic music, although
he had only begun to write for the theatre, as
we know, at an age when many men have finished
their career.</p>

<p>STATUE OF RAMEAU IN PARIS OPERA HOUSE<br>  <br>  Reproduced from a photograph made for this work by special permission. One of four life-size statues placed in the vestibule of the Opera House, at the foot of the grand marble staircase.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Hippolyte et Aricie” met with but doubtful
success, about which there was difference of opinion.
Accustomed as the public was to the flowing music
of Lully, that of Rameau was considered brusque
and his harmonies rough and dissonant. They were
indeed very bold for the time. What astonished
the amateurs and put to rout the imitators of Lully,
such as Colasse, Desmarets, Blamont, was the
novelty of the modulation, the suddenness of the
changed chords, the character and style of the instrumentation.
With Rameau, the flutes, hautbois,
bassoons, manifested themselves at intervals, without
any interruption of the general theme of the symphony.
Rameau sought to give and gave to each
instrument its own particular force and value, which
enhanced the interest without detracting in any
degree from the unity of style of the piece.</p>

<p class='c007'>At a later date, when he had attained the full
measure of his experience, Rameau certainly produced
better work than “Hippolyte et Aricie.” At
the same time this first opera of the great French
master is full of dramatic beauty and attractive conceptions.
We may cite, as an example, the charming
chorus of nymphs in the prologue, the graceful
gavotte which was sung: “A l’Amour rendons les
armes.” And again, the fine air sung by Aricie in
the first act, the chorus, “Dieux vengeurs, lancez
le tonnerre”; with a purely instrumental page to
imitate the thunder, which certainly does not equal
the storm of the pastoral symphony, but which at
the same time is not wanting in effect, particularly
the violin arpeggios. The second act, the scene
of which is laid in the infernal regions, is characterized
by a boldness of harmony and a striking
novelty for the period. The two first movements
of the first scene are simply pure Weber. The rest
is of the same fantastic character.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no musician, however humble his attainments,
who does not know and admire the trio
of the Fates, “Quelle soudaine horreur.” The succession
of chords on the words, “Où cours-tu, malheureux?”
are striking in their expression. This
would appear even at the present day as a happy
and wonderfully effective discovery.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Les Indes Galantes,” an heroic ballet, was the
second work that Rameau gave to the Opéra. He
was then fifty years of age. The public, who had
become more accustomed to the musician’s peculiarly
characteristic style, received this work in the
most favorable manner. From that time forth, the
master who had experienced such difficulty in obtaining
access to the Opéra, was rewarded with one
long series of triumphs. He reigned in the opinion
of the musicians and the habitués of the Académie
de Musique as an omnipotent sovereign of the art.
“Les Fêtes d’Hébé,” “Dardanus,” “Zoroastre,”
“Anacréon,” “Platée,” “Les Fêtes de Polymnie,”
“Les Fêtes de l’Hymen et de l’Amour,” are works
which bear the impress of Rameau’s genius. His
talent appeared to the most advantage, however, in
“Castor et Pollux,” his dramatic masterpiece,
which indeed is a fine example of theatrical music.</p>

<p class='c007'>We mentioned above the theoretical works of Rameau,
and now propose to make further reference
to them. Rameau’s theory, which threw a flood of
light upon what before his time was darkness and
empiricism, is entirely based upon the eternal law
governing the creation of chords by the resonances
of the monochord. Rameau found in these resonances
the <em>fundamental bass</em> of the different chords
composed of a succession of thirds. This discovery
of the fundamental bass showed the true nature of
the inversions of chords which before the theoretical
exposition of the great Dijon master had been considered
as so many peculiar kinds of chords.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rameau had discovered the natural formation of
chords, a thing wonderful in itself and sufficient to
make his name immortal; but in thus establishing
the principles of harmony he had not established all
its laws. He left to his didactic successors the work
of laying down the important rules of the attraction
of notes for the determination of chords, as also the
rules governing their movement in modulation. It
is thus that we find in Rameau’s work certain
hazardous harmonies which are more due to the
non-observance of these laws than offences against
good taste or fancies of the composer’s imagination.
We see, indeed, in the music of this artistic genius
successions of fifths, faulty relation of notes, brusque
modulations offensive to the ear, which are nothing
more than faults in writing. Thus he who has been
truly called the “Father of Harmony,” made mistakes
in harmony which, even at the present day,
in spite of the great liberty taken by composers of
the advanced school with their successions of modified
chords, still remain faults in musical grammar.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rameau wrote his last opera, “Les Paladins,” at
the age of seventy-seven. In reading this score we
find nothing to indicate any failing of the vigorous
mind of this extraordinary musician, who, following
Lully, was the pioneer in the great field of dramatic
music that Gluck was destined to cover with incomparable
power and genius.</p>

<p class='c007'>This article would be very incomplete were we
not to say a few words concerning the pieces for
the harpsichord composed by Rameau, which form
such an important item in the fine work by A. Mereaux,
“Les Clavecinistes,” containing a selection
of pieces by these musicians from 1637 to 1790,
classed in their chronological order, and revised,
annotated and accented with the variations and ornaments
of the period and in full notation. What
pianist of the present day has not delighted in
playing, from amongst the numerous compositions
by Rameau for the harpsichord, his “Musette,”
“Tambourin,” “Poule,” “Rappel des Oiseaux,”
“Fanfarinette,” “Egyptienne,” and “Entretiens
des Muses,” etc. Few pianists, however, have
succeeded in executing these delightful inspirations
on the instrument for which they were
written, and which gives them their full effect, with
all the freshness of idea, color, and ingenious accompaniment.
It is a feast for a musical epicure to
hear music by Couperin, or Frescobaldi, or Scarlatti
played by an educated musician and pianist of
taste, in conjunction with music by Rameau executed
upon a well-preserved or newly-manufactured harpsichord.
For the celebrated piano manufactory of
Pleyel, Wolff et Cie., of Paris, yielding to the desire
expressed by a few artists and amateurs, has made
for them a limited number of harpsichords which
out-rival in a remarkable manner, both as to quality
of sound and the number of pedals, the finest instrument
of the celebrated Taskin.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1888, the Paris Society of Musical Composers
gave an exclusively artistic soirée in the Salle Pleyel,
the memory of which yet remains. By the side of
magnificent grand pianos, the most noble instruments
produced by this musical establishment, was a harpsichord,
which gave promise of great things. It
was not found wanting when put to the test; for,
in the hands of M. Diémer and Mme. Roger-Miclos,
two virtuosos whose reputation is well established,
it rendered the music of the composers who wrote
for the harpsichord in a wonderful manner, particularly
the pieces by Rameau.</p>

<p class='c007'>A statue has been erected to the memory of
Rameau in his native town of Dijon, due to the
initiative of a Dijon composer of considerable talent,
M. Poisot, who opened a subscription in order
to put on record the public admiration for this
great and illustrious musician of Burgundy.</p>

André Ernest Modeste
Grétry, the author of “Richard
Cœur de Lion,” was born at Liège
on the 11th of February, 1741.
At the age of seven years he was
placed by his father, a poor musician
and one of the violinists of the Collegiate
Church of St. Denis, as a chorister in that church.</p>

<p class='c007'>The unfortunate little boy, who was of a delicate
constitution and who suffered from hemorrhages
throughout the whole of his laborious existence, was
obliged to walk six times every day from his
home to the church—a distance of about a mile—in
order to take part in the services. Matins
were sung, even in the most rigorous days of winter,
between five and six o’clock in the morning. One
day the child arrived somewhat late at this early
service, and although he was not to blame, the
choir-master obliged him to remain upon his knees
for two hours in the midst of his fellow choristers.
This punishment had such an effect upon little
Grétry, who was naturally of a timid disposition,
that he would awake several times during the night
in a state of fear lest he should arrive too late.
“Without considering the hour or the weather, I
would often start off as early as three o’clock in the
morning, through snow and ice, and would sit down
at the door of the church, warming my hands at my
little lantern, which I held on my knees. In this
way I used to sleep more peacefully, because I was
sure that they could not open the door without
waking me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Grétry finally emancipated himself from this choir,
which was a veritable scholastic place of torment,
having learned scarcely anything of music. His
first professor of any importance was the organist of
the Church of St. Pierre at Liège, M. Renekin, who
gave him lessons in counterpoint for two years, and
kindly encouraged him in his early essays in instrumental
music. The young musician also studied
under Moreau, a talented musician and a methodical
and conscientious professor.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to finish his musical studies and because
of an ardent desire to visit other countries,
Grétry conceived the idea of going to Rome to
establish himself there. The idea of separation was
not a pleasant one for his father. He opposed it
for two reasons: his son’s delicate health, and the
expense which would necessarily be incurred.
However, there was no choice but to yield before
the determination expressed by this young aspirant
to musical glory; and Grétry, who was then eighteen
years of age, started from Liège for Rome. He
set forth on foot—being destitute of the means
which would enable him to make this long journey
by coach or on horseback—after having seen performed
a mass of his own composition, in recognition
of which a present was made him by the
canons of St. Denis.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a small stock of money and a pair of pistols
given him by his grandfather to defend himself
against the highwaymen—there were highwaymen
then, and many of them on the roads of beautiful
Italy—Grétry set out with a guide named Remacle,
who, in spite of his sixty years, was accustomed to
travel on foot from Liège to Rome, and from Rome
to Liège, regularly twice a year. His ostensible
profession was that of a guide, but he also followed
the less respectable and more remunerative calling of
smuggler. Remacle fraudulently carried into Rome
quantities of fine Flanders lace, while from
Rome he brought back relics and Popes’ slippers
which he supplied to the convents in the Netherlands.
Whether these slippers had really been
worn by his Holiness and whether the relics had
the origin ascribed to them by the honest Remacle,
it is not necessary to inquire here: rumor said so,
and by faith we attain salvation.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the day fixed for the departure of the
young musician arrived, the guide went to the house
of Grétry’s parents. His coming might be likened
to the appearance of a spectre to this poor couple,
so deeply affected were they by the departure of
their child. Without a word the little fellow laid
hold of his valise and strapped it on his back; then
knelt down with his hands clasped before his father
and mother and asked their blessing. “God bless
thee, dear child!” were the simple words pronounced
by the broken-hearted parents, and then
the traveller disappeared with his guide.</p>

<p class='c007'>The son was not less moved than his father and
mother, whose kindly faces were bathed in tears and
wore the ashy hue of death. “As soon as I was able
to think calmly,” writes the musician, “I felt tears
trickling down my cheeks, and I said: ‘O God,
grant that thy poor creature may one day become
the support and consolation of his unfortunate
parents!’” How touching is this simple scene,
how eloquently does it speak in favor of this patriarchal
household which Grétry, by his genius, has
made illustrious; and how strongly are our sympathies
moved by the immortality earned for it by this
most sensible of sons!</p>

<p class='c007'>The brave youth, who was accompanied by a
young surgeon, walked regularly ten leagues a day
with his knapsack upon his back. Those were hard
day’s marches. At Trèves the two young men
began to fear that they would not be able to go any
farther, but their energetic determination gave them
strength, and they continued their journey, still at
the rate of ten leagues a day. They passed through
the Tyrol, singing the while, and braved the dangers
of the avalanches, and a few days later stood in
rapt admiration of the beautiful land of the Milanese.
They afterward visited the artistic curiosities of
Florence. Every part of Italy was in their eyes
an enchanted region. At last Grétry saluted the
Eternal City, which he entered by the Porta del
Popolo. He had ample time to make himself
thoroughly familiar with Rome and to carefully study
the works of the Italian masters, then so greatly
renowned; for he remained at least nine years in
Italy. Here he made his early efforts in sacred and
in theatrical music, but without achieving any brilliant
success. He was then feeling his way, and did
not as yet know for what particular style of music
he was best fitted. Chance, however, brought to
his notice a comic opera by Monsigny, and he at
once felt that his true vocation was the music best
suited to comedy. But as Paris was the only field
which offered him the means of making himself
known to advantage in this branch of musical art, he
resolved to settle in the French capital.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this biography of Grétry it would be unjust to
omit the name of the Swedish Envoy, the Comte de
Creutz, who raised the musician’s hopes and helped
him to continue his struggle at times when he
felt greatly depressed. M. de Creutz had divined
the degree of genius exhibited in the early attempts
of our musician, although they had not been
publicly successful, and it is fitting that his name
should be mentioned in connection with the successes
of his illustrious protégé. Grétry never lost an opportunity
of testifying his deep gratitude to M. de
Creutz.</p>

<p class='c007'>When, after his long sojourn in Italy, the composer
was guided by his lucky star to settle in Paris,
he had neither harpsichord nor pianoforte, and it
appears that for some time he pursued his studies
without having one of these instruments which are
of the first necessity for a composer. It was upon
a clavichord lent him by M. Louet that the composer
wrote: “Les Mariages Samnites,” “Lucile,”
“Le Huron,” “Le Tableau Parlant,” “Le Sphinx,”
“Les Deux Avares,” “L’Amitié à l’Epreuve,” and
“Zemire et Azor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the clavichord, which was the predecessor
of the spinet, brass rods are used instead of pen
nibs to make the chords vibrate. Grétry’s clavichord,
which may be found in the interesting collection
of the Instrumental Museum at the Paris
Conservatoire, possesses only four octaves and two
notes, as was usually the case with the clavichords
of the seventeenth century. We asked permission
of M. Pillaut, the learned conservator of the Instrumental
Museum, to take a photograph of this clavichord,
which is not only highly interesting in itself,
but because it was the faithful confidant of the
master’s inspiration. M. Pillaut gave the permission
asked, and we think it right to tender him our
thanks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grétry passed the last years of his life at Montmorency,
near Paris, in a house called the <em>Hermitage</em>,
where the celebrated writer Jean Jacques
Rousseau lived for some time and died. Here,
retired from the world, Grétry received his faithful
friends of the last days, notably D’Alayrac and Boieldieu,
who lived in a cottage near the <em>Hermitage</em>.
The old master loved to talk about his art to those
who succeeded him in the career, and he lavished
upon them the precious counsels of his experience.
It was in acknowledgment of this great service that
Boieldieu dedicated to Grétry his charming <cite><span lang="fr">Opera-Comique,
“Jean de Paris.”</span></cite> During the latter part of
his life Grétry composed nothing, and after the
death of his wife, which occurred March 17, 1807,
he very rarely visited the theatre. In 1812 Grétry
partially rewrote his score of <cite>Elisa</cite>, which was his
last bit of composition. On Sept. 12, 1813, feeling
very ill, he wrote the following
letter to M. Le
Breton, life secretary of
the department of Fine
Arts at the Institute:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear colleague:
It is impossible for me to
be present at the Institute
for the judgment of the
musical prize. On arriving
at the Hermitage, still
convalescent, I was attacked
with a hemorrhage
which lasted three days,
and from which I lost a
pint and a half of blood,
leaving me extremely
weak. I now await the
end of my long sufferings.
I am resigned, but
in leaving this life, I feel
that one of my keenest
regrets will be never
again to meet my dear
colleagues whom I love
no less than I honor
them. I pray you to let
them see this letter.
Adieu, my dear colleague;
I embrace you with
all my heart.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A few days later, Sept. 26, 1813, the author of
<cite>Richard Cœur de Lion</cite> passed away. The funeral
ceremony took place in Paris, with great solemnity.
The pall-bearers were Méhul, Berton, Marsallier
and Bouilly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grétry’s heart has been the object of much discussion,
and even a tedious law suit. The composer
had often expressed in his lifetime the desire that
his heart should be offered to his native city, Liège.
M. Flamand, one of Grétry’s nephews, having
obtained from the prefect of police at Paris the
authorization to have the body exhumed in order to
send the heart to Liège, wrote to the mayor of that
city and offered him this precious token of the
illustrious composer’s ardent love for his native
country. The mayor responded in such terms as
to cause M. Flamand to reconsider his proposition,
and the heart was kept at the Hermitage.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1821 the city of
Liège reclaimed the bequest
which had been
made it, but this time M.
Flamand absolutely refused
to deliver it up. A
lawsuit followed which
was decided by the court
substantially as follows:
that since the extraction
of Grétry’s heart had been
demanded by the family
and granted by public authority
solely for the purpose
of paying homage to
the city of Liege, which
had prepared a monument
to receive it, therefore
it should be withdrawn
from the garden
of the Hermitage, and
sent to the commissioners
of the city of Liège. This
decree was not carried
out. The prefect of the
Seine and the minister of
the interior objected.
The question was then
carried before the council
of state, and in 1828, fifteen
years after Grétry’s
death, the precious leaden
box containing the heart of the illustrious composer
was carried to Liège.</p>

<p class='c007'>We cannot close this biography of the most celebrated
musician of Liège—one of the most musical
cities in Europe—without mentioning the Musée
Grétry at the conservatory in the capital of the
Walloon country. This most interesting museum,
where may be seen the objects which either formerly
belonged to the celebrated composer or serve to
remind us of him, is the personal work of the
present director of the Liège Conservatoire, the
learned and distinguished composer, Theodore
Radoux. We have had the pleasure of visiting this
museum—a veritable shrine—accompanied by M.
Radoux, who described the various objects exhibited,
in a most lucid and instructive manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grétry left Rome for Geneva in the month of
January, 1767. A short time before, Favart’s
“Isabelle et Gertrude” had been represented at
the Comédie Italienne in Paris. It was a success,
but the music seemed to be weak. Grétry seized
upon this comedy and wrote new airs for it. “Isabelle
et Gertrude” was represented at Geneva, and
was very well received.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Paris Grétry was present at a representation of
“Dardanus,” by Rameau, which he did not altogether
understand, and which, as he admitted later,
he found to be almost wearisome. He was still too
full of the memories of Italian music—although it
had exercised very little real influence on his genius—to
be able to thoroughly appreciate at its proper
value this essentially dramatic French music, which
was at times somewhat crude as to harmony and
melodious expression, but always suited to the
action. Nevertheless, although this work of the
immediate predecessor of Gluck did not appeal
to him strongly, Grétry was not long in recognizing
its true merit. He told himself that Music, although
not merely the humble handmaid of Poesy, with which
she is allied, ought to aid her to express her feelings
with due effect, and that consequently theatrical music
should, as far as possible, be subject to the rules of
pure elocution. Following the example of Lully—for
whom Grétry always expressed great admiration—he
was wont to attend the Théâtre-Français
to find the notes, so to speak, of spoken declamation,
and unite it intimately with song and melody.
Moreover, the difficulty he experienced in finding a
piece to set to music gave him a good deal of leisure;
indeed the first two years of Grétry’s stay in Paris
were devoted to a search for a poem. At last he
obtained from an unknown poet named du Rozoy,
“Les Mariages Samnites,” a piece in three acts
which was destined for the Comédie Italienne but
was not accepted at that theatre and was afterwards
rewritten for the Opera. The work was represented
there, but with great difficulty and bitter mortification
for the composer.</p>

<p class='c007'>This essay, which failed to impress the public of
the Académie de Musique, was followed by “Le
Huron,” a comedy in two acts by Marmontel, which
was represented for the first time at the Italiens on
the 20th of August, 1769. The piece was unanimously
and we might say even enthusiastically
applauded, both by the audience and by the critics.
Above all, the care taken by the composer as to
good prosody and the proper feeling peculiar to the
<em>dramatis personæ</em>, was greatly applauded. The songs
were considered very happy, although they did not
exhibit that graceful variety of form and contour
then characteristic of the music which the public
were accustomed to hear at the Italiens by masters
like Piccinni, Pergolèse, Jomelli, Galuppi, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>After “Le Huron” was given “Lucile,” also a
poem by Marmontel, in which a quartet on the
words: “Où peut-on être mieux qu’au sein de sa
famille?” was long celebrated. But in reality
“Le Tableau Parlant,” the comic opera which followed
“Lucile,” consisting of one act in verse by
Ansaume, produced at the Italiens, was the starting
point of Grétry’s fortune. While fully preserving
the good humor of the subject of the piece and the
words which are sung during its progress, the composer
succeeded in clothing the work of the author
of the words with impressive sonorousness, the telling
and well-chosen passages being at the same time
instinct with frank gaiety.</p>

<p class='c007'>From that day forth, it may be said that the celebrated
composer thoroughly realized his capacity,
and it was easy to see that he would take his place
in the first rank of comedy in music.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Grétry did not and could not succeed in grand
opera music. Nature had not endowed him with
the lofty sentiment of lyric tragedy; he would have
needed a courage bordering upon temerity or a high-strung
imagination to dare to measure himself with
the formidable Gluck, surnamed the Æschylus of
music. But if lyric tragedy was a closed book to
him, he nevertheless succeeded at the theatre of
the Grand Opera in lyric comedy, which he was the
first to bring to the notice of the Academy. Grétry
himself takes care to tell us this fact in the following
passage of his book: “When I introduced lyric
comedy on the stage of the opera, I was looked
upon as a culpable innovator, and yet I saw that the
public was weary of tragedy, which was always on
the boards. I heard many lovers of dancing murmur
because their favorite art was only allowed to
play a subsidiary and frequently a useless rôle in
tragedy. I saw the managers
who were desirous of
adopting the best possible
productions, and were feeling
their way, unsuccessfully
revive fragments or pastorals
of former times, and I said
as often as I had the opportunity
that two styles of
music placed in opposition
lent each other mutual
charms; that the French
comedians alternately produced
tragedy and comedy,
and that if they were
obliged to give up these two
styles they would not know
what to do.” It would appear
that the public of the
Grand Opera shared Grétry’s
opinion, as the composer
gave several comedies
to that theatre which were
brilliantly successful, in particular “La Caravane du
Caire,” which had a long and fashionable run. This
piece was represented for the first time before the
Court at Fontainebleau in October, 1783, and a
little later at the Opera. At court, as before the
general public, the piece and its music gave the
greatest delight to the spectators. The short but
brilliant and extremely graceful overture of this work
speedily became popular, not only in France but all
over Europe. The morceaux of song are gay but
elevated and are all agreeable, although the public
would have liked them better had they been more
strongly tinged with oriental color than they are.
If Grétry did not possess the dramatic afflatus in
lyric tragedy, he exhibited in all his operas of a
semi-character an elevated style which, combined
with his exceptional wealth of melody, places him
in the first rank of the French masters of the last
century. He gave to pathetic scenes a wonderful
sublimity, an admirable instance of which may be
found in the beautiful prison scene in “Richard
Cœur de Lion.” In this work, the fruit of such a
rich imagination, Grétry has exhibited the full
measure of his genius and all the talent of which he
was possessed as a harmonist. It is interesting to
remark in regard to this opera that Grétry made of
certain portions of the celebrated ballad, “Une
Fievre brûlante,” a sort of
<em>leit motiv</em> after the manner
of Wagner. Indeed, this
fragmentary theme returns
again and again under different
aspects at least nine
times in the course of the
score. But we shall see
later that Grétry was Wagner’s
predecessor not only
for the <em>leit motiv</em>, but that
he was also the first to suggest
an invisible orchestra
such as that of the theatre
of Bayreuth. As to the
characteristic theme of “Richard
Cœur de Lion” (the
fragmentary ballad considered
in its transformations
as playing the part of the
modern <em>leit motiv</em>), it is curious
to notice that Grétry
used it in this comic opera
with exactly the same idea as Wagner in his lyric
dramas. Whenever allusion is made to the royal
prisoner, described in the ballad sung by Blondel, a
fragment of this air appears. And when Blondel
sings to this same air, but in common measure, the
following words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">Sa voix a pénétré mon âme,</span></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“is it not,” writes Grétry, “as though he said:
‘His voice has gone to my heart while he sang the
air which he made for you.’”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Richard Cœur de Lion”—the denouement of
which was changed by the author of the piece,
Sedaine, at least three times—marks the culminating
point of the master’s career. The piece
had a great and lasting success, and it remains still
in the répertoire of the Opéra Comique. The instrumentation
has been reconstructed in a very
careful and happy manner by Adolphe Adam.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this work Grétry produced several others,
which did not, however, meet with the same good
fortune. Nevertheless, Grétry occupies a place of
honor in the history of theatrical music, and his
style is remembered as original. If he never acquired
the dexterity of the adepts at counterpoint
then in renown, and if his harmonies are at times
awkward and even faulty, they still have a peculiar
attraction which makes them not only acceptable
but original and charming.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day when I went to see Auber in his little
house in the Rue St. Georges I found the author of
“La Muette de Portici” and the “Domino Noir”
at the piano with one of Grétry’s scores in front of
him. “Just look at this passage,” said Auber, “it
is very curious, considered as to the succession of
chords. This harmony is certainly not correct, and
would never have entered the mind of what is called
a musical savant. And yet if you try to change it
you may make it more accurate, but it will be wanting
in relief and expression.” That is because the
awkwardness of Grétry is the awkwardness of an
artistic genius, and awkwardness of that kind is a
thousand times better than the accuracy of the cold
and unimaginative musician.</p>

<p class='c007'>I said above that Grétry had the first intuition
of the <em>leit motiv</em> in “Richard Cœur de Lion,” as a
device for recalling to the spectator either an event,
a scene, an essential object or a personage, with
their distinctive peculiarities, at the same time preserving
unity of style in the general construction of
his work;—I said that he also imagined an invisible
orchestra such as that which exists in the
Wagner Theatre at Bayreuth. Grétry speaks as
follows in his work, “Mémoires et Essais sur la
Musique,” in the chapter entitled: “Plan for a
new Theatre”:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should like the auditorium of my theatre to be
small, holding at the most a thousand persons, and
consisting of a sort of open space without boxes,
small or great, because these nooks only encourage
scandal or worse. I should like the orchestra to be
concealed so that neither the musicians nor the
lights on their music-stands would be visible to the
spectators. The effect would be magical, the more
so as it is always understood that the orchestra is
not supposed to be there. A solid stone wall ought,
in my opinion, to separate the orchestra from the
theatre, so that the sound may reverberate in the
auditorium.”</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
On December 15, 1775, there was
born in Rouen a composer who was
to leave an indelible imprint of his
abilities upon the operatic music of
France. At the beginning of his
career there was nothing in his circumstances that
could have presaged his future greatness. He was
the son of the secretary of Archbishop Larochefoucauld,
and his mother kept a small millinery store in
the old-fashioned city. His parents did not enjoy
perfect conjugal felicity, and finally their quarrels led
to a divorce, soon after which the father married
again. The young Boieldieu was designed for a musical
career, and his father soon sent him to the cathedral
as a choir-boy. In those days music was
frequently made a matter of apprenticeship, and was
studied almost as if it had been a handicraft; it is
therefore not surprising to find the lad indentured to
the cathedral organist Broche, who led him a sorry
life. Those who are familiar with the early life of
Haydn will recall how that composer was forced for
a time to be merely the lackey of Porpora; Boieldieu
was in still worse case, for his master was both a
drunkard and a martinet, and many a corporal punishment
was inflicted on the apprentice merely because
of errors in musical exercises. It seems
strange that the rough induction into the art did not
cause the lad to hate music and finally desert it, but,
as was the case with Beethoven, the tears of childhood
only seem to have cemented the foundation of
his education. Broche made the curriculum hard
and dry enough, and the companions of the lad
(“le petit Boiel” they called him then) added to
his discomforts by laughing at his shyness and awkward
ways.</p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally enough Boieldieu stood in mortal terror
of his brutal taskmaster, and the culmination of his
fright came one day when he accidentally upset an
ink bottle on one of Broche’s books; expecting nothing
less than capital punishment for such a heinous
crime, the boy took to his heels, and, at the age of
twelve, ran away to Paris. How he managed to get
there without money or assistance is not clearly
known, but he eventually arrived and sought out some
relatives who dwelt in the French metropolis. These
gave him shelter, but at the same time notified his
parents, who soon took him back to his musical and
menial drudgery. Nevertheless his condition seems
to have been bettered by his escapade, for Broche
was warned to use milder measures with him, and he
remained at his studies with the organist until he
was sixteen. During these four years his taste for
operatic music began to awaken, and he was a constant
attendant at the performances in the provincial
theatre. As he had no money he was obliged to resort
to all kinds of expedients to obtain admission,
and there are many anecdotes extant of his ingenious
efforts to hear this or that opera without going
through the slight preliminary of paying for his admission.
At times he would slip into the theatre
early in the morning, carrying a bundle of music, as
if he had been sent as messenger to some of the orchestra,
and then, by hiding through the day, often
without food, he managed to stand through the performance
in the evening, after which he would hurry
home well contented with his good fortune. The
operas which he heard at this period of his career
were chiefly those of Grétry or of Mehul, as both
composers were much in vogue at that time, and he
was much influenced by their light and melodious
style. It was not long before his ambition was
awakened to an attempt to imitate them and to compose
an opera himself. He was eighteen years old
when he accomplished this task. He had sought in
vain for a libretto, and finally had recourse to his
father, who gave him the text for an opera which enjoyed
an evanescent success. “La Fille Coupable”
was the name of this Opus 1, which was completed
in 1793 and has now disappeared. One can imagine
that the audiences were neither over-refined or
hypercritical in those days of the Reign of Terror, but
a more cultivated era soon followed, and the second
opera, which came two years later, and was entitled
“Rosalie et Myrza,” was less favorably received.
Boieldieu was not yet ripe for operatic composition,
but at least these works furthered his career in that
they obtained him the privilege of free entrance to
other operatic performances, and thus his experience
and taste were gradually expanded.</p>

<p>BUST OF BOIELDIEU BY DANTAN.<br>  <br>  From the Carnavalet Museum, Paris.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The partial success fired his heart sufficiently for
him to leave Rouen and seek Paris for the second
time. This time he carried with him thirty francs, an
operatic score, and an abundance of self-confidence.
He was now nineteen years old. His reception was
the chilling one usually accorded to young composers
in Paris, and very soon he began to feel the nippings
of hunger, which put the thoughts of public success
out of his head for the nonce, and drove him to teaching
piano. He however had the good fortune to
make the acquaintance of the celebrated tenor Garat,
and this gentleman became interested in him,
and finally sang some of his <em>chansons</em> in public and
in fashionable drawing-rooms. These little songs
soon found favor, and Boieldieu became gradually
known through them. M. Cochet, the publisher,
paid him twelve francs each for these productions, a
figure which seems ridiculous until one remembers
that Schubert sometimes accepted a franc or two for
some of his immortal <em>lieder</em>. Some of these early
works of Boieldieu are still in the musical repertoire,
and are occasionally heard in concerts, as for example,
“O toi que j’aime,” and “Menestrel,” and
they served at the time to spread the social success
of the composer. Finally Boieldieu made the acquaintance
of Fiévée, the novelist, who wrote for him
a short libretto in one act, “La Dot de Suzette,” and
this opera, after many intrigues and jealousies,
achieved performance and success, thanks to a bright
libretto, sparkling melodies, and the excellent performance
of Madame St. Aubin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Boieldieu’s prospects now changed with Aladdin-like
suddenness, for his next opera, “La Famille
Suisse,” was performed at the Theatre Feydeau for
thirty nights in alternation with Cherubini’s “Medee,”
and thus early began that connection with the
great Italian maestro, at that time the best musician
in France, which was to be so fruitful of good results
to the new favorite. In 1798 Boieldieu turned for
a while from operatic work, and composed a number
of piano sonatas, piano and harp duets, and a piano
concerto. Although these exercised no permanent
influence on the art, they obtained for him the
appointment of professor of piano at the Paris Conservatoire,
two years later. In this position, however
he was not very successful; he was too much
wrapped up in composition to make a good teacher.
The musical historian Fétis, who was his pupil, confirms
this estimate; but the post at the Conservatoire
led to a close acquaintance with Cherubini, by
which Boieldieu began to remedy his lack of knowledge
of counterpoint and fugal work. Although
Fétis denies that Boieldieu was ever the pupil of
Cherubini, there is every reason to believe that this
was the case, even if a regular stipend was not paid
for the tuition. The very fact that in 1799 the two
worked in collaboration on “La Prisonnière” might
tend to show that Boieldieu was anxious to attain
something of Cherubini’s musical learning, and his
submission of many later operas to the judgment of
this master proves that he was willing to be guided
by him.</p>

<p class='c007'>About this time Boieldieu produced two operas
that carried his fame beyond his native country;
these were the Polish “Benjowski” and the very
tuneful “Caliph of Bagdad,” both of which will receive
further mention in the analytical portion of
this article. A little later there
appeared a more advanced work,—“Ma
Tante Aurore.” The success
was now so well established
that all Parisian managers sought
for works from the gifted pen,
and opera followed opera.</p>

<p>TOMB OF BOIELDIEU IN PÈRE LACHAISE, PARIS.<br>  <br>  From a lithograph.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Boieldieu now lived on contentedly
in Paris until 1802, when he
almost wrecked his career in the
same manner that his father had
done; on March 19th of that year
he married a ballet-dancer named
Clotilde Mafleuroy, and immediately
began to taste the bitterness
of conjugal misery. He suddenly
left Paris on this account and
sought employment in Russia.
He was received in St. Petersburg
with open arms, and the Czar
Alexander at once appointed him
<em>capellmeister</em> of the court. He
produced little on this barren soil
however, and although he stayed
there eight years, and his contract
called for three new operas and
a number of military marches
annually, scarcely anything of this
period has been preserved. In
1810 the political horizon began
to darken, and trouble between
Russia and France became so
imminent that our composer again suddenly
packed up and returned to his beloved Paris,
arriving at the beginning of 1811. Here however
he found everything changed. The Napoleonic
wars had exerted a deleterious influence on
operatic patronage, and the taste, too, had changed
in some degree; Cherubini and Mehul were
silent, and Isouard alone ruled <i><span lang="fr">Opera Comique</span></i>.
Considerable jealousy of Boieldieu was at this time
displayed, and at first he was unsuccessful in having
any of the works he had written in Russia performed
in Paris; therefore he set himself to producing an
original work, and in 1812, “Jean de Paris,” a
masterpiece of its kind, was produced at the Theatre
Feydeau. Again a success was won, although
not such a phenomenal one as the “Caliph of Bagdad”
had attained, and for the next six years another
series of operas proved that the composer had
not lost his hold upon the Parisian public, and in
addition to his own operas Boieldieu collaborated
with Cherubini and Isouard. Two years later a
great success attended the first production of “Le
Chaperon Rouge,” but the composer was so exhausted
by this effort that he was obliged to rest for
a while from further composition. He now received
the position of professor of composition at the
Conservatoire, taking the place of Mehul, and for
seven years he produced nothing more in opera.
The crowning work was however to come later.
During a stay at his brother’s farm in Cormeilles
Boieldieu began composing once more. This time
it was something far beyond his previous efforts, it
was a <i><span lang="fr">chef d’œuvre</span></i> in the domain of comic opera,—the
ever-beautiful “La Dame Blanche.” This
masterwork was performed in December, 1825, and
at once awakened boundless enthusiasm. Boieldieu
was not much exhilarated by the result, for he
seemed to feel that he could never hope to equal
this work again. Nevertheless he soon attempted
another subject, as if to ascertain if his surmises
were correct. Bouilly’s dull libretto, “Les Deux
Nuits” was accepted, as much from friendship as
from any other motive. The new opera was finished
in 1829, and made a flat failure, a result which hurt
Boieldieu’s feelings in an inordinate degree. He
had brought back a pulmonary trouble from Russia,
and his disappointment seemed to aggravate the
disease. He gave up his position at the Conservatoire,
feeling too weak to continue teaching. The
director of the <i><span lang="fr">Opera Comique</span></i> had given Boieldieu
a pension of 1200 francs for his great services to
the art, but the expulsion of Charles X. now came
about, a new direction was installed, the institution
was found to be bankrupt, and the income from this
source ceased just when it was most needed. He
had married again in 1827, and this time the union
was a fortunate one, for in these final days of trial,
sickness, and pecuniary difficulty, his wife sustained
his drooping spirits with unswerving fidelity. She
was a singer, Philis by name, and was the mother of
Boieldieu’s only son, a composer of good attainments,
but overshadowed by his father’s ability.
Finally Louis Philippe was established on the throne
of France, and his minister, M. Thiers, made speedy
recognition of the value of Boieldieu’s work by
granting him an annual pension of 6,000 francs. It
could not give back the composer’s health, however,
and, after a tour to Pisa he came back worse. He
had been obliged by poverty to take back his old
position at the Conservatoire, and made a brave
effort to continue in it, but it was useless; in another
tour in hopeless search for health, he died at Jarcy,
October 8th, 1834. At the tomb his old companion
and teacher, Cherubini, gave a last tribute
to the modest and talented nature that had passed
away so prematurely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Boieldieu may be summed up in a single phrase
as a Parisian Mozart. He had Mozart’s gift of melody
and grace, and in his later years something of
Mozart’s skill in harmonic and contrapuntal combination,
but, unlike Mozart, his work can be divided
into three epochs, the third only being comparable
in <em>ensemble</em> to the works of the German master.
Boieldieu has been ranked as the best composer of
<i><span lang="fr">opera comique</span></i> that France ever produced, and it is
not too much to say that only Bizet has approached
him in characteristic touches and poetic inspiration.
Three works are at present the chief representatives
of Boieldieu’s fame, “The Caliph of Bagdad,” which
shows his earliest method, “Jean de Paris,” which
is a good example of his second period, and “La
Dame Blanche,” which is the finest of all his operas,
the best outcome of the French <i><span lang="fr">opera comique</span></i>
school, and shows the composer in his third and
best period of growth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Boieldieu was never misled by the popular applause
which was showered upon him before it was
fairly deserved. It has been well said that “there
is no heavier burden than a great name acquired
too soon,” and it is to the credit of Boieldieu that,
although he acquired this burden with “The Caliph
of Bagdad,” which has had over a thousand performances
in France, he did not continue in the
rather frivolous vein which had so captivated his
earliest audiences. His modest desire to advance
may be proven by the fact that when this opera was
achieving its greatest success, Cherubini reproached
him with “Malheureux! are you not ashamed of
such an undeserved success?” when Boieldieu mildly
begged for further instruction, that he might do
better in the future. He even courted the opinions
of his pupils in the Conservatoire as to portions
of his work, a rather dangerous meekness. Pretty
tunes and marked rhythms are the characteristics of
this period. “Zoraime et Zulnare,” although at
present almost unknown, always remained a favorite
of the composer, but it is only another example of musicians
not being the best judges of their own works.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Benjowski” is a transition towards his second
period. It has a Polish plot written by Kotzebue,
and its music has much local color. It was composed
in 1800, but was retouched by Boieldieu a
quarter of a century later, when he wittily said, “It
smells of Russia leather!” The opening quartette
in this work is very dramatic.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ma Tante Aurore” may be said to begin the
second period. It preserves the brightness of the
first period, but is much finer in its scoring, and
it is no exaggeration to say that in this matter
Boieldieu surpassed all of his contemporaries in
France, with the sole exception of Cherubini. The
versatility displayed in this period speaks of growth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The eight years spent in Russia may be passed
over with but slight comment, for of all that he
wrote there, he cared to preserve but three operas,
“Rien de Trop,” “La Jeune Femme,” and “Les
Voitures Versées.” One cause of the weakness of
the works of this period was the fact that no good
librettos were obtainable, and the composer was
even obliged to use many that had been set by
other musicians.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some commentators class “Jean de Paris” in the
third period of Boieldieu’s work. It is a beautiful
and characteristic opera; the song of the Princess,
full of charming grace, the bold and dashing measures
of the page, and the stiff, ceremonious style of
the music of the Seneschal, are a few of the striking
touches that go to make up a very brilliant work
which has not yet disappeared from the repertoire,
but when compared with “La Dame Blanche” the
ensemble-writing is seen to be inferior. In this
latter opera, the climax of his works, Boieldieu did
not depart from the melodious character of his first
and second periods, but rather added to it. All
through his career he clung to the folk-song, and exactly
as “Der Freischütz” was evolved by Weber
from the German <cite><span lang="de">Volkslied</span></cite>, so “La Dame Blanche”
had its root in the French <em>Chanson</em>. The libretto
was evolved by Scribe from Scott’s works by amalgamating
the “Monastery” and “Guy Mannering,”
but spite of the introduction of “The Bush aboon
Traquier” and “Robin Adair” (the latter not a
true Scotch song) the flavor is by no means Scotch
either in libretto or music. The harmonization of
the finales of this opera is beyond anything that
has been attained in French <i><span lang="fr">opera comique</span></i>, and
shows Boieldieu as a master in a school of which we
find no traces in “The Caliph of Bagdad.” Yet
through all the three periods one finds the thread of
the <em>Chanson</em> running melodiously. Music that is
sincerely national can never die, and the secret of
the success of Boieldieu’s operas, and their perennial
freshness may be found in the fact that the
composer builded upon the music of his country,
and there is no firmer foundation possible.</p>

One of the most unique and interesting
figures in the French musical
world of the close of the
eighteenth century is Etienne
Nicolas Méhul. Sprung from
comparative obscurity, he mounted to a world-wide
fame. Starting out in life with the scantiest educational
advantages, he reached a high degree of elegant
culture. Living in a most dissolute period, he
retained through life an irreproachable character.
The son of a cook in a regimental barracks, he was
tendered the position of chapelmaster by the great
Napoleon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Méhul was born at Givet, in the Ardennes, June
22, 1763. Like many other great composers, he
was of low degree, had but few opportunities for
study at the start, and struggled hard to gain his
musical footing. His talent displayed itself at an
early age and he himself never had a doubt as to
his ultimate vocation in life, though his naturally religious
disposition had predetermined his parents to
send him to a monastery. At ten years of age he
played in the Franciscan Church at Givet, such qualifications
as he may have had being the result of his
studies with a blind organist. Shortly after this time,
Wilhelm Hauser, a distinguished German organist,
arrived at the neighboring convent of La Val Dieu,
whither the boy repaired to pursue his studies. He
was fortunate enough to attract the favorable attention
of the Abbé Lissoir, under whose auspices he
studied for three years with Hauser. He made such
rapid progress that he soon equalled his master and
was appointed deputy organist at the convent. It is
altogether probable that he would have been his successor
had not good fortune attended him again.
His playing attracted the notice of an officer of the
garrison, who was a musical amateur, and it needed
but little solicitation to induce the boy to go to Paris.
He arrived at the capital in his sixteenth year and
placed himself under the tuition of Edelmann, a
Strasburg composer of eminence, who some years
afterward deserted music for politics and perished
ultimately upon the same scaffold to which he had
consigned many a victim. With Edelmann he
studied both the piano and composition, supporting
himself meanwhile by giving lessons and writing sonatas
and minor compositions for that instrument.
The genius of his good fortune did not desert him
in these days of stress. It was shortly after his arrival
in Paris that Gluck’s “Iphigénia en Tauride”
was placed in rehearsal. The popular interest in
the performance had been heightened by the feud
which had raged so bitterly between the Gluck and
Piccini factions. Méhul caught the infection and,
being without the money to purchase a ticket, he
smuggled himself into the theatre the day before,
intending to remain in concealment until the next
eventful evening. He was discovered, however, by
one of the inspectors, and as the latter was on the
point of ejecting him, Gluck’s attention was drawn
to him. He made some inquiries, and upon learning
the facts in the case gave the young man a ticket.
It was the turning-point in his career and decided
the direction he should take; for Gluck followed up
the chance acquaintance, took a decided interest in
Méhul, gave him the benefit of his experience and
advice and instructed him in the dramatic qualities
of music. The young composer already had produced
a cantata at the Concert Spirituel, written
upon the subject of Rousseau’s Sacred Ode, and
was ambitious to become known as a composer of
church music, for the religious element was always
strong in him; but Gluck changed all this and set his
feet in the path of the opera, which he was destined
to follow to the end of his life.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Méhul began his dramatic work by writing three
operas (“Psyché et l’Amour,” “Anacréon” and
“Lausus et Lydie”) merely for the sake of practice.
He was testing his wings before flight. He made
his debut before the public with “Euphrosine et
Coradin” in 1790 and achieved a brilliant success,
though his first opera was “Cora et Alonzo,” which
was produced later and met with only a moderately
favorable reception. He was now in the full tide
of musical activity, and opera after opera came
from his prolific genius. “Stratonice” followed
“Euphrosine,” and by many was considered his
masterpiece, especially for the fine treatment of
the ’cello parts, which instrument he had specially
studied, and for the general excellence of the orchestration
as well as its dramatic strength, in which
quality he showed his close study of Gluck. The
revolutionary period which now ensued was not favorable
to the opera, and as if in sympathy with the
depressing character of the time, Méhul brought forward
such works as “Doria,” “Horatius Cocles,”
“La Caverne,” and others, which did not add to his
reputation. There were others, however, that proved
an exception to the rule. “Le jeune Henri” for instance,
was hissed because it introduced a royal personage,
but the overture, with its lively and picturesque
representation of the chase, was demanded
several times over at the close of the performance.
The overtures to both “Adrien” and “Ariodant”
were also general favorites, as well as the romanzas in
the latter. It was about this time (1799)
that Méhul had his first encounter with some
of the French critics, particularly Geoffroy,
a well-known writer, who declared that he
could not write in any other than a severe
and heavy style. Shortly afterwards the opera
of “Irato,” written in the Italian style, appeared
anonymously. After its first performance
the journalist wrote: “This is the way
in which Méhul should compose.” The composer
had his revenge on declaring himself
the author and followed it up with another
opera, “Une Folie,” in which his critic was
satirized. Soon afterwards, however, he lapsed
into the serious style. In 1806 he produced
“Uthal,” in which he made the daring innovation,
at the suggestion of Napoleon it is
said, of doing away with the violins entirely
and filling their places with the violas, as
better adapted to the sombre Ossianic character
of the composition. The result was so
depressing that Grétry, who was present at
the first performance, made the remark: “I
would give a louis to hear the sound of a
chanterelle, or the E string of the violin.”
Undismayed by the reception of “Uthal,”
Méhul followed it up with “Joanna,” “Hélène,”
“Les Amazones” and “Gabrielle
d’Estrées,” all written in the same serious style,
showing high scholarship in counterpoint, but lacking
in those light and elegant graces of composition
which were so popular with the French. His
activity was great during this period. Between 1791
and 1807 he wrote no less than twenty-four operas,
besides six symphonies; music to poems of Chénier,
Arnault and Sontanes, composed in honor of the
Republican fêtes at which Napoleon presided,
among them the “Chant du Départ,” “Chant de
Victoire” and “Chant de Retour”; choruses to
the tragedy of “Timoleon”; the incidental music
to “Oedipus” and the drama of “The Hussites”;
four ballets, “Le Jugement de Paris” (1793), “La
Dansomanie” (1800), “Le Retour d’Ulyss” (1807),
and “Persée et Andromède” (1810); besides many
operettas and smaller works. He had enjoyed the
favor of Napoleon to such an extent that upon the
death of Paisiello he was offered the position of
chapelmaster. Méhul, who was a devoted friend of
Cherubini, was anxious that the latter should share
the office with him, but Napoleon, who was incensed
at a sharp reply Cherubini had made him in Vienna,
sent word back to Méhul: “What I want is a chapelmaster
who will make music and not noise,” and at
once nominated M. Sueux to the position. Méhul
was not without his honors, however, having been
appointed a member of the Institute in 1795, and of
the Legion of Honor in 1802.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1807 he achieved the crowning success of his
career. “Joseph,” written on a Biblical subject,
was produced and spread his fame all over France
and Germany. Though not often heard in this
country, it still remains a great favorite to-day
among the Germans by its dignity, nobility and
elevated style. It made ample compensation for
his many failures and regained for him all the
advantages he had lost. After 1810 he wrote but
little, “Le Prince Troubadour” (1813) and “L’Oriflamme”
(1814), written with Berton, Kreutzer and
Paer, being his most important works.</p>

<p class='c007'>Méhul made his parting bow to the public with
the opera of “La Journée aux Aventures,” which
was produced in 1817 with considerable success.
The same year closed his earthly labors. He had
been in ill health for some time, and shortly after
the production of his last opera he went, upon the
advice of friends, to the south of France, where he
had a residence, hoping thereby to regain his
strength. His ailment, consumption, however, had
so weakened his constitution that the change was
fruitless. Moreover, he was homesick for Paris.
In writing to a friend he mournfully says: “I have
broken up all my habits. I am deprived of all my
old friends, I am alone at the end of the world,
surrounded by people whose language I can scarcely
understand—and all this sacrifice to obtain a little
more sun. The air which best agrees with me is
that which I breathe among you.” He returned to
Paris, warmly welcomed by his friends and the public.
He made one, and only one more visit to the
opera. He was soon stricken down in his last illness
and died Oct. 18, 1817, in his fifty-fourth year,
universally lamented both in France and Germany,
for, like his pupil Hérold, he was as much of a
favorite in the latter country as in the former. In
fact neither of these composers was appreciated to
the full extent of his ability in France, at least
until after death, a neglect which was not confined
to them, however: Berlioz shared the same fate.
More than one French composer indeed has made
his greatest success in Germany. Tributes of respect
and admiration were shown to his memory in
both countries. His funeral was attended by a
great concourse of persons, and the pupils of the
Conservatory with which he had been identified so
many years, covered his grave with flowers. On
the day of his interment memorial services were
held in many places in Germany and France at
which public addresses were made. Méhul married
a daughter of Dr. Gastoldi, but having no children
adopted his nephew, M. Daussoigne, a young
musician of excellent promise. His posthumous
opera, “Valentine de Milan,” was finished by the
nephew and was performed in 1822, upon which
occasion the composer’s bust was publicly crowned.
The popular success, indeed, which he achieved as a
composer, was unquestionably expedited by his
high character as a man. His uprightness and
natural tenderness had commended him to all the
pupils of the Conservatory, and his strong affections
did the same service for him with his friends. His
generosity and benevolence were proverbial. The
utter absence of jealousy in his disposition especially
commended him to musicians. He had a particular
abhorrence of intrigue and of those small rivalries
which were abundant at that time, and which sometimes
developed into great wars, as has already
been hinted at in the reference to the famous
struggle between the factions of Gluck and Piccini,
which not only enrolled musicians, composers and
opera-goers in opposing ranks, but even brought
courtiers, the nobility and members of the royal
family into fierce antagonism. In the midst of all
this small turbulence Méhul had carried himself
with even poise, working for the best interest of his
art and always true to its canons, though he made
many tentative innovations when fortune frowned
upon him. At a time of more than ordinary dissipation
and immorality, he maintained the highest
moral principles and a sterling manhood. It was
but natural, therefore, that such a man should have
been mourned sincerely, and it may have added to
public admiration that he had reached his high
distinction by his own efforts, rising from rude and
obscure beginnings to the summit of European
fame.</p>

<p class='c007'>Méhul was the legitimate successor of Gluck. It
was that composer’s “Iphigénie,” as we have seen,
that first caught his fancy, fired his ambition and
directed his attention to dramatic composition. It
was owing to Gluck himself, who at once recognized
the ability of the young musician, that his feet were
set in the right path, and it was to his advice and instruction—the
instruction of a friend rather than
of a teacher—that he owed his discovery and appreciation
of the dramatic quality of music. Other
composers, among them Cherubini, had a certain
influence upon him, but Gluck was the all in all
of his system, the source of his inspiration and the
dominant element of his methods of treatment. He
clung to dramatic truth with as much tenacity as did
the great author of “Orpheus” and the “Iphigénias”
and strove with the same earnestness to make
his music a close and perspicuous illustration of the
text, and to keep it elevated in style. Meanwhile
his own nature was assisting him. Style and character
are closely related, and Méhul’s music is a reflection
of his own personal traits, namely, refinement
of sentiment, seriousness and earnestness of
presence, strong religious tendencies as shown in the
opera—or shall we not call it oratorio—of “Joseph,”
and nobility of character as shown in all his dramatic
work. His style is always elevated, though at
times he made the effort to unite light and graceful
melodies of the effervescent and short-lived sort
which find so much favor on the French stage. He
was not successful in these, however. He was more
at home in passion and pathos, in strong, broad
motives, rich harmony and ingenious and elaborate
accompaniments. In a word, his standards, like those
of Gluck, in whose steps he followed so closely, were
classical and of the highest romantic type. At times
he was daring and ingenious in his innovations, as
in “Ariodant,” where four horns and three ’cellos
carry on an animated conversation; in “Phrosine et
Mélidore,” where four horns have a full part in the
score; and in “Uthal,” where the violas are substituted
for the violins, as already has been mentioned.
These, however, were only experiments, though they
serve to show his originality of conception as
well as his curious scholarship—a scholarship all
the more remarkable when the poverty of his early
training is considered. And yet he did more than
almost any other of his contemporaries to elevate
the Opera Comique, and has come down in musical
history as one of the principal founders of the
modern French School.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Méhul’s activity was almost incessant. He has
left forty operas, of which the following are the more
important: “Alonzo et Cora” and “Euphrosine et
Coradin” (1790); “Stratonice” (1792); “Le
jeune Sage et le vieux Fou” (1793); “Horatius
Cocles,” “Arminius,” “Phrosine et Mélidore” and
“Scipion” (1794); “La Caverne,” “Tancrède et
Chlorinde” and “Sesostris” (1795); “Le jeune
Henri” and “Doria” (1797); “Adrien” and
“Ariodant” (1799); “Epicure” (with Cherubini)
and “Bion” (1800); “L’Irato” (1801); “Une
Folie,” “Le Trésor Supposé,” “Joanne” and
“L’Heureux malgré lui” (1802); “Helena” and
“Le Baiser et la Quittance,” with Kreutzer, Boieldieu
and Nicolo (1803); “Uthal,” “Les deux
Aveugles de Tolède” and “Gabrielle d’Estrées”
(1806); “Joseph” (1807); “Les Amazones”
(1811); “Le Prince Troubadour” (1813); “L’Oriflamme”
with Berton, Kreutzer and Paer, (1814);
“Le Journée aux Aventures” (1816); and the posthumous
opera, “Valentine de Milan,” finished by his
nephew, M. Daussoigne, and first performed in 1822.
Besides these dramatic works he has left four ballets,
several symphonies, songs, operettas and incidental
dramatic music to which reference has been
made in the body of this article. Méhul’s literary
ability, though never specially cultivated, was of a
surprising kind, considering his early disadvantages.
He has left two reports which have been greatly
admired,—one upon the future state of music in
France and the other upon the labors of the pupils
in the Conservatory. Taken all in all, he was one of
the most earnest, high-minded, conscientious and
thoroughly artistic composers France has produced.
He carried on the great work of Gluck and is one
of the important links in the evolution of music
which led up to Richard Wagner and his music-dramas.</p>

Louis Joseph Ferdinand
Hérold, who played a conspicuous
part in the elevation and enrichment
of the opera comique,
though now principally known by
only two of his many operas, “Zampa” and “Le
Pré aux Clercs,” was born at Paris, Jan. 28, 1791.
His father, François Joseph, an Alsatian by birth,
was a musician of more than ordinary ability. He
had been a pupil of Philip Emmanuel Bach, was a
professor of the piano, and also composed music
for that instrument. Little is known of the mother
except that she sympathized with her son’s talent,
which displayed itself at a very tender age, for in
his sixth year the precocious boy was writing little
pieces for the piano. Upon the advice of Grétry, the
composer, whom the parents consulted, he was sent
to the Institution Hix, where he had his first lessons
in music. He made such rapid progress that in
1806, the year in which his father died, he was
encouraged by Fétis and other competent critics to
make music his profession. He entered the Conservatory
in the same year as a member of the piano
class of Louis Adam, his godfather, and won his
first honor by taking the piano prize in 1810. He
subsequently extended his curriculum, studying
harmony with Catel, the violin with Kreutzer, and
composition with Méhul, who years afterward said
of him on his deathbed: “I can die now that I
know I leave a musician to France.” The success
which marked his career in the Conservatory is
indicated by his securing the Prix de Rome in 1812
with his cantata, “Mlle. de la Vallière.” The
coveted honor opened wide the doors of music to
him with the added advantages of foreign travel.
The next two years were spent by the young musician
in Italy, during which period there was a notable
change in his style of composition. His first
works were a hymn for four voices, two symphonies
in C and D, and three quartets in D, C and G
minor. The quality of these works, which are now
treasured in the Conservatory, gives ample promise
that he would have been a successful instrumental
composer, but circumstances ordered otherwise.
During his stay in Naples he was attached to the
court of Queen Caroline as pianist, and to please
her majesty he devoted himself to dramatic composition
with an enthusiasm which soon aroused an
ambition to excel in this class of writing. His
aspirations were still further heightened by the success
of his first dramatic work, “La Jeunesse de
Henri V,” produced in 1815, and to the opera he
now devoted himself with an industry that never
flagged. Well schooled and practiced as he might
have been in instrumental writing, it evidently had
limitations which were not agreeable to a composer
of strong emotions, vivid imagination and distinctly
dramatic tendencies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hérold returned to Paris shortly after the successful
production of his first opera, stopping en route
in Vienna, where he made many musical acquaintances.
Arrived at the French capital he at once
made his arrangements for an active and busy
season of writing for the stage. His first concern
was to find a libretto adapted to his purpose, and
it was while engaged in this difficult search that
good fortune came to him in the request of Boieldieu
that he would write the last half of an opera
upon which he was then engaged, “Charles de
France,” and which was brought forward in June,
1816. Collaboration of this kind was far from
being uncommon at that period, particularly in
France. He not only wrote “Charles de France”
with Boieldieu, but “Vendome en Espagne” with
Auber, and “L’Auberge d’Auray” with Carafa,
while in “La Marquise de Brinvilliers” no less than
nine composers of prominence were represented—Hérold,
Auber, Batton, Berton, Blangini, Boieldieu,
Carafa, Cherubini and Paër. The rage for collaboration
also spread to literature and has been
continued even into our time by Erckmann-Chatrian.
The results of such work are more tolerable
however in literature than in music, where unity of
style is one of the essentials. His association with
Boieldieu was of special advantage in introducing
him to the theatrical world of writers, and he soon
was at no loss to find libretti, good, bad and indifferent,
many of them, it must be confessed, of the
last two sorts. His first opera after the Boieldieu
collaboration was “Les Rosières,” in three acts,
(1817), which proved to be a success. Flushed
with the prestige of this work the young composer
immediately set about another, and before the year
closed had finished “La Clochette,” which not only
was successful, but as its fresh and taking airs caught
the popular fancy, at once made him a favorite in
the gay city. His industry now became prodigious.
He was seized with the very demon of work and
while in this mood he eagerly accepted everything
that was offered him in the way of a libretto as
affording a new outlet for his musical activity. The
result was detrimental. Year after year he produced
operas for the stage, some of which had but
one or two hearings, while others were vigorously
hissed, not on account of the music, but by reason
of the weakness and commonplaceness of the
stories and their utter lack of dramatic merit.
Among such operas were “Le premier Venu”
(1818); “Les Troqueurs” (1819); “L’Auteur
mort et vivant” (1820); “Lasthénie” (1823);
and “Le Lapin Blanc” (1825). Now and then,
however, an opera was produced which made compensation
for so many failures, and among these was
“Le Muletier” (1823), which was highly esteemed,
especially by those whose opinions were of value.
In fact Hérold had no idle moments. During all
of this period, and for two or three years later
(1820–29), he was actively connected with the
stage. In 1820 he accepted the position of piano
accompanist for the Italian Opera and held it for
seven years. In 1821 he was dispatched to Italy
with a commission to engage artists, and from 1827
to 1829 was chorus master at the Académie de
Musique. All this was practical experience of a
valuable kind in the accessories and environments
of his profession, and undoubtedly contributed
many of the elements which led up to his ultimate
success as an operatic composer by giving him a
knowledge of the details of the stage, the habits
and peculiarities of singers, and the limitations of
the dramatic art which are so essential to the complete
equipment of the composer. During a portion
of this period he turned to other forms of
composition. In 1827, he devoted himself to
ballets. Of these, “Astolphe et Joconde,” “La
Sonnambule,” “La Fille mal gardée,” “La Belle au
bois dormant” and “Sylvie” are the most conspicuous.
All of them are characterized by the same
graceful and romantic style which is to be found so
often in his operas. During this same period he
wrote a voluminous amount of piano music, such as
sonatas, caprices, rondos, fantasies, divertissements
and variations, the most notable being a sonata in
A flat, the “L’Amante disperato” sonata, the Rondo
Dramatique, the “Pulcinella” caprice, variations
on “Au clair de la lune,” “Marlbrook,” an arrangement
of the “Moses in Egypt” of Rossini,
whose music largely influenced his style, and incidental
music to the drama of “Missolonghi,” which
was produced at the Odeon. A letter written by
his friend Chanlieu refers to this period. In speaking
of the failure of some of his operas, M. Chanlieu
says: “How many times in our solitary walks
he lamented lost time and forced inaction! Disgust
mastered him and made itself felt even in his
piano music which, with the exception of two or
three other works, was a species of current money
to which he attached no value. It was, however, at
that time that he wrote his fantasias on themes by
Rossini, which had a great sale and at which he was
the first to laugh. The spirit of youth still sustained
him; he was gay and vivacious in private, but in
public morose and caustic.” Rossini not alone
influenced his musical style. It was through his
courteous and kindly offices that Hérold received
the decoration of the Legion of Honor, Rossini
going so far even as to refuse it for himself unless
it were also awarded to his friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>To return to his operatic compositions, there were
some others during this gloomy period of frequent
failures which achieved success, among them, “Vendome
en Espagne” (1823), which he wrote with
Auber, “Le Roi Réné” composed for the fête of
Louis XVIII., “Marie” (1826) and “L’Illusion”
(1829), which enhanced his reputation and paved
the way for the two works which were to be the
crowning successes of his life. “Zampa” was produced
May 3, 1831, and aroused something like a
furor in Paris, though its most enduring success has
been made in Germany. It still keeps the boards
upon the continent, and though rarely heard in this
country, its overture remains a conspicuous feature
of concert programmes. With “Zampa” Hérold’s
success was firmly grounded, though the work bears
unmistakable indications of German influence and
is written in the broad, serious style characteristic
of the German composers. It is for this reason
that it has been more favorably received in Germany
than in France, though its merit was fully recognized
by Hérold’s own countrymen. It restored the waning
fortunes of the Opera Comique, saved it from
ruin, and made Hérold a popular favorite. At this
time he was chorus master, but a few weeks after
his success he was dismissed by the new director
upon the excuse that it was necessary to retrench.
He had only a verbal contract, but he appealed to the
courts, and his appeal was sustained after nine
months of litigation, the courts holding that there was
an implied contract. He accordingly was reinstated,
but soon the fortunes of the Opera were involved
in another financial crisis. The director sought
to retrieve them with a sensation and in 1831 brought
out the musical play of the “Marquise de Brinvilliers.”
Scribe and Castil-Blaze wrote the text together,
and nine composers, whose names have been
given elsewhere, arranged the musical setting. The
combined efforts of the collaborators, however, failed
to produce anything more than a nine days’ wonder,
and the doors of the Opera were reluctantly
closed. Six months later a new location was chosen
and the opera once more made its appeal to the
public with a new work by Hérold, “La Médecine
sans Médecin.” Its success fell far short of that
which “Zampa” had enjoyed, but it served the purpose
of keeping the Opera on its feet until Hérold
had finished another work which was destined to
complete his fame and to restore the Opera Comique
to its old prestige. It was, alas, his swan song.
“Le Pré aux Clercs” was performed Dec. 15, 1832.
It had a success of enthusiasm. Unlike “Zampa,” it
was a purely national opera, with an historical theme
treated with genuine French grace and spirit, and
abounding in characteristic French music which
commended it to the Parisians. Its reception was
attended with a remarkable display of excitement
and popular acclamations. The audience rose to a
man and called for the composer but he was unable
to make an appearance. The fatigues of rehearsals
and the tumultuous events of the evening were too
much for his already enfeebled condition. He was
taken home, but had hardly arrived there when he
had a dangerous hemorrhage. He lived but four
weeks after his great success, dying of consumption
Jan. 19, 1833, the same disease which had proved
fatal in his father’s case. His funeral took place on
the 21st. He was buried at Père la Chaise, near
Méhul, and addresses were made at the grave by
Fétis and Saint-George. He left a widow, Adèle
Elise Rollet-Hérold, to whom he was married in
1827, and three children, Ferdinand, an attorney,
Adèle, and Eugenie who also was a musician. “Le
Pré aux Clercs” was not his last work in the list of
performances, for after his death the overture and
four numbers of another opera, “Ludovic,” were
found among his papers. The work was completed
and produced with success by Halévy. His biographer,
M. Jouvin, says of it: “In what proportion did
this posthumous child of Hérold belong to its father
and its godfather? I know not. I have not the
opera of ‘Ludovic’ under my eye. I have not been
admitted into the secret of the work done by the
musician who two years later wrote ‘La Juive’ and
‘L’Eclair’ without taking breath. I only charge
myself to report, without guaranteeing, a tradition
which attributes to Hérold the overture and four
pieces in the first act of this lyric drama.”</p>

<p>HÉROLD’S TOMB IN PÈRE LA CHAISE, PARIS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The peculiarities of Hérold’s style which distinguished
him from the other operatic composers of
his period were the freshness and originality of his
ideas, the grace and refinement of his conceptions,
which are displayed to special advantage in his ballets,
the variety of his melodies, and the highly emotional
and imaginative character of the man himself.
He was the legitimate successor of Boieldieu and
reflected his romantic moods, and it will be remembered
coöperated with him in his first work after his
return to Paris from Italy. With these purely subjective
qualities he combined an instrumentation
that is always rich in color and dramatic in effect,
an intimate knowledge of the stage and its resources,
and a superior degree of literary taste and culture,
though the latter distinction did not always save him
from accepting commonplace and sometimes worthless
libretti. The reason for this is probably to be
found in his prodigious activity, which induced him
to accept such poor books in the hope that his music
would excuse them, rather than spend his time
in idleness. Though possessed of undoubted originality
if not of actual inspiration, he was greatly influenced
by the works of the composers, though in no
sense can he be considered a copyist. During his
Italian visit he was much impressed with Paisiello.
In a letter to his mother about the year 1815 he
says: “I have fallen into one error here—that of
neglecting M. Paisiello.... I can say that I study
much the music of Paisiello and find it delicious.”
The Italian influences did not last long however.
Upon his return to Paris he was devoted to the music
of Méhul, with whom he had studied in the Conservatory.
Rossini influenced him greatly for a time
and how far he had studied Mozart is shown in
“Zampa,” which was constructed upon the lines of
“Don Juan.” In this connection, M. Scudo, in his
criticism of “Zampa,” makes the following pertinent
remarks: “The side of this work that stands open
to criticism is, as nearly always with Hérold, confusion
of styles. The austere and sober phrase of
Méhul is found in company with Italian bravura.
The chansonette disperses with its importunate
cockcrow all the phantoms worked from the supernatural.
Mozart, Méhul, Weber, Rossini, Auber,
how many more?—may be found in the hybrid
formation of this superb monster. Under the mobile
structure of that orchestra, so full of presentiments
and mysteries, you distinguish Weber. Those
duets, those Venetian colored finales, conceived,
worked with the vigorous authority of a master,
speak to you of Rossini, while here and there the
small details, the grace, the spirit, the lively and
piquant features murmur in your ears the names of
Boieldieu and Auber.” His own thoughts which
he committed to paper, however, and which were
found among his documents after his death, will give
a clue to his style and to his ideas of what constituted
artistic excellence. Among many other things
he says: “Melodies must come from the soul to
reach the soul of the auditors.” “Try to find a
just medium between the vague music of Sacchini
and the vigor of Gluck. Think often of Mozart and
his beautiful <i><span lang="fr">airs de mouvement</span></i>.” “Lean always to
the side of melodies free from platitude.” “In all
arts, and particularly in music for some time past,
people are skilful in finishing and polishing without
reflecting how much more important is a good
general design.” “Of melody as much as possible.”
“Declaim with truth and strength.” “Find themes
which bring tears.” “‘Great sorrows are silent’ observed
Seneca. Thus Hero seeing the floating
corpse of Leander held her peace. He who goes
to the Opera only to hear the music had better frequent
the concert-room. The musical tragedian
ought above all to sing but ever in agreement with
the situation.” And then, as if to answer the comments
of some of his critics: “Why not use several
styles in a great work? A chief priest can sing
in the ancient manner, the others in the modern.”
“Church music ought to pray for those who listen
to it, as said Salieri.” M. Gustave Chouquet, the
keeper of the Museum of the Paris Conservatory,
has well summed up the characteristics of Hérold
in his analysis of “Zampa”: “In a word we recognize
in ‘Zampa’ the hand of a master, who to the
spirit of Italian music unites the depth of the German
and the elegance of the French School.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The principal works of Hérold include twenty-two
operas, one cantata, five ballets, three sonatas, three
string quartets, two symphonies, seven caprices,
seventeen rondos and divertissements, seven fantasies
and three variations. Of the operas the
following have been the most successful: “La
jeunesse de Henri V.” (1815); “Charles de
France” (1816); “Les Rosières” (1817); “La
Clochette” (1817); “Le Muletier” (1823);
“Vendome en Espagne” (1823); “Marie” (1826);
“L’lllusion” (1829); “Zampa” (1831); “La Médecine
sans Médecin” (1832) and “Le Pré aux
Clercs” (1832). Though none of these works can
be called familiar in this country, it can hardly be
doubted that the two operas “Zampa” and “Le
Pré aux Clercs,” which saved the Opera Comique,
and which paved the way for Ambroise Thomas,
Bizet, Massenet and the modern French school,
would repay revival and achieve fresh popularity.</p>

A life more peaceful, happy and
regular, nay, even monotonous, or
one more devoid of incident than
Auber’s, has never fallen to the
lot of any musician. Uniformly
harmonious, with but an occasional musical dissonance,
the symphony of his life led up to its
dramatic climax when the dying composer lay surrounded
by the turmoil and carnage of the Paris
Commune. Such is the picture we draw of the
existence of this French composer, in whose garden
of life there grew only roses without thorns; whose
long and glorious career as a composer ended only
with his life; who felt that he had not lived long
enough, and who clung tenaciously to life, energetically
refusing to drop this mantle of mortality,
postponing the final moment by the mere strength
of his powerful determination to live.</p>

<p class='c007'>Auber, the most Parisian of Parisians, who could
never tear himself away from his dear native city,
even for a short excursion in the summer, was born,—as
it happened—at Caen, towards the end of
the month of January, 1782. I say, “as it happened,”
because the composer’s parents were not
settled in that town and were only staying there
temporarily when the future author of “La Muette
de Portici” made his entrance upon the stage of
life. His father was a print-seller in Paris. Being
a thorough business man he wished his son to become
a business man also. To this end, when his
child had received a somewhat summary education,
and had almost reached man’s estate, he sent him
to London to begin his career in a house of business.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even at this early period the young Auber was
considered a distinguished amateur musician. He
played the piano well, and had made successful attempts
at minor composition, such as ballads, small
morceaux for the piano, etc. Realizing that he was
not fitted for a business life, but for that of a musician,
Auber returned to Paris, where he was not long in
making for himself a reputation in the fashionable
world. He was looked upon as an agreeable pianist
and a graceful composer, with sparkling and original
ideas. He pleased the ladies by his irreproachable
gallantry and the sterner sex by his wit and vivacity.
During this early period of his life Auber produced
a number of <em>lieder</em>, serenade duets, and pieces of
drawing-room music, including a trio for the piano,
violin and violoncello, which was considered charming
by the indulgent and easy-going audience who
heard it. Encouraged by this success, he wrote a
more important work, a concerto for violins with
orchestra, which was executed by the celebrated
Mazas at one of the Conservatoire concerts. He
also composed, for his friend Lamare, concertos
which were applauded by the general public. This
Lamare was a violoncellist of great talent and erudition,
but so barren of musical creative power that
he could not originate the simplest melody nor compose
a note for his own instrument. Auber adapted
his music so cleverly to the playing of the eminent
instrumentalist that Lamare said to him: “Nobody
would think, my dear Auber, that I was not the
composer of these concertos, so strongly are they
impressed with my personality.” To which Auber
replied: “Since that is so, my dear Lamare, the
concertos shall be published in your name.” And
as a matter of fact they were so published, successively,
under the name of the violoncellist. The
public thought he was the author of them, but
musicians were aware of the truth, which has been
an open secret for a considerable time.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is evident that although Auber made his début
as a dramatic composer at a late period, he early
practised this art as an amateur, producing his compositions
in the Paris drawing-rooms. These drawing-rooms
were his academy of music up to the
time when, convinced that he had still much to
learn in the practice of counterpoint, he sought assistance
from the illustrious Cherubini, whom he was
destined one day to succeed as director of the Paris
Conservatoire.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first work that Auber submitted to public
judgment was a comic opera in one act, entitled
“Le Séjour Militaire,” which was produced at the
Théâtre Feydeau in 1813. Auber was then thirty-two
years old. This piece was not his first attempt
in theatrical work, however; for he had previously
written a comic opera for the Prince de Chimay,
and before this, still another work for a small
orchestra, which was represented in an amateur
theatre. He had also composed a Mass, with
orchestra, in which occurred the admirable chant
which he used at a later date in the famous prayer
in his masterpiece, “La Muette de Portici.” “Le
Séjour Militaire” may be regarded merely as marking
a date in the biography of the French composer.
This piece, of somewhat doubtful buffoonery, passed
unnoticed by the general public. Indeed the musician
himself was very slightly impressed with it,
being but imperfectly inspired when he wrote it.
Nevertheless a writer then celebrated, M. Martinville,
discovered in this score several pretty <em>motifs</em>
and a great deal of wit.</p>

<p class='c007'>From 1813 to 1819 Auber remained silent, and
it might have been thought that he had ceased to
exist. What became of him during this long
period? He still continued to appear in society
and, when in the humor, to write as an amateur
fugitive pieces of music set to subjects of the same
character. He asked dramatic poets to write pieces
for him, but they were not very anxious to do so
after the failure of “Le Séjour Militaire.”</p>

<p class='c007'>About this time the composer’s father died, leaving
a widow and two sons without fortune. During
this period, when the eminent musician that was to
be was still pursuing his studies, he found himself
face to face with pecuniary difficulties; but he supported
them bravely, never complaining.</p>

<p class='c007'>Planard, the most fashionable librettist of that
day, was accustomed to gather around him in his
little house at Passy—which was not then considered
one of the districts of Paris—a company of
amateurs and artists. There was music, and Auber,
one of the most assiduous habitués of the house,
accompanied on the piano. In this way it came
to pass that Madame Planard took a great interest
in Auber and espoused his cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear,” she said to her husband, “can you
not entrust one of your poems to poor Auber, who
is so well-bred, so witty, and so good an accompanist?
I am convinced that he will earn himself a
name among our composers. It is a pity that he
should compose operatic airs without words because
he has none to work on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Women always gain the day, whenever they plead
in favor of the unknown and the lowly, and Auber
was then both unknown and lowly. Madame Planard
pleaded so well in this particular instance that
her protégé obtained from Planard two pieces instead
of one to set to music. The first was a piece
in one act, entitled “Le Testament et le Billet
Doux,” which unfortunately met with a much less
favorable reception from the public than “Le Séjour
Militaire,” and that had been a failure. The
next venture was “La Bergère Châtelaine,” in three
acts, and it made ample amends for all previous
mortifications. Its success was unanimous and
brilliant. None too soon indeed. Had the author
lost this opportunity his future as a composer would
have been irretrievably ruined, for no poet would
have entrusted him with a libretto.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the time when Auber produced “La Bergère
Châtelaine,” the turning-point in his artistic career,
he was thirty-eight years of age, just a year younger
than Rossini when he closed his with that immortal
masterpiece “Guillaume Tell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Planard, having witnessed the failure of “Le
Testament,” would have liked to take back the
libretto of “La Bergère Châtelaine” which he had
handed over to Auber some time before. But now
he was very happy to have another of his pieces, in
three acts, entitled “Emma,” set to music by the
composer. This work was represented at the
Théâtre Feydeau in 1821, and was an extraordinary
success. The high road to fortune was now open,
and for more than forty years the composer’s career
was one long series of triumphs, which continued
to the last day of his life. One might have thought,
after the complete success of the two last comic
operas upon which Auber and Planard collaborated,
that they would have continued to work together
for a long time; but it was not so. Scribe had
just then attained his brilliant position as a writer
of vaudevilles. Fate had decided that there should
be a partnership between him and Auber, a partnership
which of all the combinations that ever existed
between word-writer and musician was the happiest
and most lasting.</p>

<p class='c007'>What was the secret of the union of these two
minds, these two talented beings who were so
well constituted to understand each other that they
seem to have been born the one for the other, to
work together for their common glory and to the
great delight of the public who applauded them so
well? It was in this wise.</p>

<p class='c007'>A vaudeville by Scribe had just been accepted at
the Théâtre de Madame, which he rightly expected
would meet with success. For a certain morceau
to be sung during the progress of the play he
thought that the air of the round in “La Bergère
Châtelaine” was wonderfully well adapted. Although
he had never yet had an opportunity of
seeing Auber, Scribe did not on that account
hesitate to write to him. This historic letter and
Auber’s reply to it have been preserved, and they
are too interesting not to be reproduced here, the
more so as they are comparatively unknown. They
are as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>To Monsieur Auber</span>:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you kindly permit me, Sir, to place in a
vaudeville which I am just now writing for the Théâtre
de Madame, your round from ‘La Bergère
Châtelaine’ which is so delightful and justly popular?
I will not conceal from you, Sir, that I have promised
my director to make the piece succeed, and that
I have counted upon using your charming music.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This note is quite gallant, but Auber replies to it
with just as much gallantry:</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span class='sc'>To Monsieur Scribe</span>:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“My round is but a trifle, Sir, and you are so
gifted that you can dispense with my poor assistance.
However, if I grant you what you ask,
although you do not really need it, and you will
allow me to lend you at the same time the fine
voice and pretty face of Mme. Boulanger, I think
we should both do a good stroke of business.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The good stroke of business consisted in the
thrice-happy collaboration which resulted from this
exchange of letters, a collaboration only broken by
the death of Scribe, which took place many years
before that of Auber. On one occasion Auber said
to me: “I owe my successes to Scribe. Without his
assistance I feel that I should never have obtained
the place I occupy in the musical world.” Without
detracting in any degree from the value of
Auber’s music, it may be said that this statement is
true; for the composer needed a librettist of
such versatile wit and resource of imagination
that I do not see amongst the comic-opera librettists
a single poet who could have taken Scribe’s
place in this work. During the whole of his life
Auber was accustomed to compose the principal
airs of his operas before the libretto was written
and almost without regard to the character of the
scene in which these airs would be used; and
to these melodies Scribe wrote words with extraordinary
ease. Auber sang the airs, accompanying
himself on the piano, while Scribe, pencil in hand,
instantly found the verses naturally suited to the
character of the music, cleverly adapting himself to
its rhythm, oftentimes very strange. I may mention
the “Seguidille” in “Le Domino Noir,” which
was a singularly difficult test of Scribe’s powers.
Another instance is the song of Henriette in “L’Ambassadrice,”
which was also written by Auber without
words. It was an astonishing feat on the part of
Scribe to find the comic and original verses which he
adapted to this melody, the scansion of which is so
very singular.</p>

<p>BUST OF AUBER.<br>  <br>  By Danton; in the Carnavalet Museum, Paris.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It was on horseback or while riding in his carriage
during his daily excursions to the Bois de
Boulogne that Auber found his happiest <em>motifs</em>. On
returning home he set them to music and inserted
them in the opera upon which he was working, and
then Scribe supplied the words. In the principal
scenes, however, Auber wrote to the verses of his
collaborator, and he would begin to work on his return
from the theatre, whither he went nearly every
evening. In this way he would write on a little
table by the side of his piano up to four or five
o’clock in the morning. As often as not, he did
not go to bed, but slept in his arm-chair. Many of
his scores bear traces of the ink which dropped from
his pen as he let it fall from his hand when overcome
by slumber. The manual of his old square
piano bears numerous inkstains on the white keys of
the upper octave, which indicate the moment when
Auber fell asleep at his work. The musician never
needed more than from three to four hours of sleep
daily, and throughout his life he took only one meal
in twenty-four hours, namely, dinner. On rising, he
would drink a cup of camomile, which he swallowed
fasting. This was sufficient to sustain him without
undue fatigue to the digestive organs up to the
time of his only meal at six o’clock. He frequently
invited to his table, frugal as it was, young professional
lady singers, for he was extremely susceptible
to the attractions of the fair sex, and remained a
worshipper of beauty even unto death. Venus was
his goddess, and he ever adored her most conscientiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>Auber had eight domestics in his service, and
never was man worse served than he. One evening
he invited to dinner several professional ladies, as
also the learned Mr. Weckerlin, librarian of the Conservatoire.
The dinner was good and well served.
Music and song followed the repast. One of the
ladies being thirsty, the master rang for a glass of
water. There was no answer. The housekeeper,
the old Sophie, whose face had been familiar for
half a century to all Auber’s friends, had gone to
bed; the cook had followed her example; the
valet-de-chambre had gone out for a walk with John,
the English coachman, who remained more than
thirty years in the composer’s service: in short, all
the servants had disappeared. Auber did not fall
into a passion: he never became angry at anything.
“As we cannot get anything here,” said he to his
guests, “let us go and take an ice at Tortoni’s.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already referred to the numerous inkstains
on the old piano, made by the pen which fell
from Auber’s hand as sleep overpowered him during
his long nocturnal labors, and we now propose to
give some details of this interesting and historic
instrument, which remains an object of curiosity to
all the admirers of the master who visit the instrumental
museum at the Conservatoire, and of which we
have been able to take a photograph by the gracious
permission of M. Pillaut, the learned Conservator of
the Museum.</p>

<p class='c007'>This piano, oblong in form, very light and built of
mahogany, was bought by Auber on the 17th of
February, 1812, in the showrooms of the celebrated
Erard. The manufacturer’s number is 8414. It is
a double-stringed instrument, and its compass is
only five and a half octaves. When, in 1842, Auber
succeeded Cherubini as director of the Conservatoire,
he had this piano brought thither and placed
it in his study. It was upon this instrument, from
which the master could never be separated, and
which had become his true friend and harmonious
confidant, an indefatigable and never-failing source
of inspiration, that Auber composed those charming
and <i><span lang="fr">spirituel</span></i> comedies which, so often performed
and always with success, have remained models of
French comic opera in common with the works of
Monsigny, Dalayrac, Grétry, Boïeldieu, Hérold, and
other great masters.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides the old piano which stood in his private
room at the Conservatoire, Auber had another at
home, in his house in the Rue St. Georges. This
latter was an upright piano which I have often seen.
Like his oblong piano, it was stained with ink on
the two upper octaves. Auber never thought, like
Ambroise Thomas and Charles Gounod, of having
made by the firm of Pleyel what is called a composer’s
piano, which is both an excellent instrument
and a secretary.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Auber once related to me that two days before
the first performance of “La Muette” (which he
completed in three months!) the overture was not
yet ready. He composed it with all the fervor
which comes of improvisation. The evening before
the first production the orchestra rehearsed
it for the first time, and the musicians accorded this
instrumental preface an enthusiastic reception. On
the first night the public were so enchanted with it
that it received a double <em>encore</em>. I have never seen
this fact mentioned in any of the biographies of the
illustrious composer, but I learnt it from Auber
himself.</p>

<p>AUBER’S RESIDENCE IN PARIS.<br>  <br>  From a photograph.<br>  <br>  In this house Auber lived for forty years, and it was here that he died in May, 1871, during the battle with the Paris Commune.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It has been a matter of astonishment that this
French musician, who did not know Italy, who
never left Paris—with the exception of a journey
to London when he was a very young man—should
have been able to introduce into “La
Muette” so much of Italian local color, and assimilate
in so wonderful a manner the musical genius
of the Neapolitans. We are in imagination as
thoroughly in Naples as it is possible to be without
actually being there, the moment we hear that
victorious march, so full of freedom, rhythm and
melody, and see on the stage the crowd of triumphant
lazzaroni now masters of the land. One would
gladly learn in what circumstances this beautiful
and marvellously characteristic air came into the
mind of the Parisian composer. Jouvin will tell us,
and he has made no mistake, for this curious information
reached him from the lips of the composer
himself: “Would you know where the composer
found the <em>motif</em> of this march, the melody of
which is so free and unconventional? He found it
in a shaving dish! It was when he was shaving
himself, with his face covered with soap, that there
came upon him the rhythm and melody of this inspiration;
and he seized and secured it before it was
lost. Such is the origin of the inspiration which
twice in the overture and at the end of the fourth
act, so powerfully appeals to the spectator in the
auditorium. O Genius, behold thy handiwork!
Have not sixty winners of the grand Prix de Rome
passed no inconsiderable time seeking inspiration in
the land of classic song and returned home without a
single idea? M. Auber, who could never tear himself
away from Paris, discovers the sky of Naples in
the lather at the bottom of a basin!”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The extraordinary effort made by Auber in the
composition of “La Muette,” in less time than
would have been needed by a copyist to transcribe
this voluminous score, completely deprived him of
his mental powers for the moment, and he was
obliged to take absolute rest for some time. His
ideas were exhausted, and he would have found it
impossible even to find a melody for a simple song.
He thought that the fountain of musical invention
was dried up within him, and for all time. But his
faculties, thank God, were not extinguished, and
there yet remained in the composer’s brain living
fountains from whence were to gush forth his best,
his most characteristic works, and those which are
most strongly impressed with the author’s style and
personality.</p>

<p class='c007'>In many respects, Auber was not an irreproachable
director of the Conservatoire, where he remained,
however, a number of years. He was all
his life too fashionable a man, too kind, too weak to
direct with the necessary firmness a school so difficult
to govern as the Ecole Nationale de Musique et
de Déclamation of Paris. He attempted no improvements
in the arrangement of the studies, and
while all public institutions throughout France were
being modified in accordance with progressive ideas,
the Conservatoire alone remained stationary and, as
it were, fossilized in its ancient condition. Ultimately
the Administration des Beaux-Arts became
alarmed at this state of things, and on the 2d of
April, 1870, the following order was issued:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the name of the Emperor, the Minister of
Fine Arts issues the following order:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Art. 1. A committee is hereby formed the mission
of which shall be to revise the present government
of the Conservatoire, and to consider and
propose such modifications as may be made, especially
in regard to the teaching in this institution,
so that the studies pursued there may be made as
profitable as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Art. 2. This committee, which shall sit under
the presidency of the Minister of Fine Arts, shall
be constituted as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“MM. Auber, Emile Augier, Edmond About,
Azévédo, Chaix d’Estange, de Charnacé, Oscar
Comettant, Félicien David, Camille Doucet, Théophile
Gautier, Gevaert, Charles Gounod, Guiroult,
Jouvin, Ernest Legouvé, Nogent-Saint-Laurens,
Emile Perrin, Prince Poniatowski, H. Prévost,
Reber, Ernest Reyer, de Saint-Georges, de Saint-Valry,
Albéric Second, Edouard Thierry, Ambroise
Thomas, J. Weiss.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The sittings of this committee were of a most
interesting character. Auber, then eighty-eight
years of age, was never absent from any of them;
but he remained silent all the while. It seemed as
though he were there in the presence of judges
rather than before a committee in which he had
full and complete liberty of discussion. Of all the
propositions made by the committee only one was
ever put into execution, by Ambroise Thomas, who
succeeded Auber as director of the Ecole Nationale
de Musique et de Déclamation of Paris. This
proposition was that Sol-fa classes should be established
especially for the pupils of both sexes in the
singing classes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Auber was Maître-de-chapelle to the Emperor
Napoleon III. He was a Grand Officer of the
Legion of Honor, and he received a number of
foreign decorations. He never married.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was Auber’s misfortune to see the siege of
Paris and the terrible deeds of the Commune. At
that time he had two horses to which he was very
much attached, named Figaro and Almaviva.
When famine began to stalk through the land he
was called upon to give up the first-named animal
to be used as food. The other met with perhaps
a still more cruel fate, for it was taken from the
elegant coupé of the composer to draw a cart at
St. Denis. In the midst of the successive misfortunes
which befell his beloved city of Paris, Auber
became deeply downcast. His strength rapidly
ebbed away, and after a terrible struggle lasting
several days, during which he fought desperately
with death—for he still clung tenaciously to life,—he
breathed his last, cared for in turn by Ambroise
Thomas, Marmontel and Weckerlin, on the 12th of
May, 1871. When public order had been re-established,
he was accorded a solemn public funeral
on the 15th of July following.</p>

<p class='c007'>Auber’s labors were devoted to one long series of
sparkling comic operas due to the happy partnership
of Scribe and Auber, a partnership in which
Mélesville was often associated. The first comic
opera produced by the triple partnership was
“Leicester,” the subject of which was taken by the
authors from Sir Walter Scott’s romance, “Kenilworth.”
Although, from the character of the dramatis
personæ, “Leicester,” was somewhat remarkable
compared with the plays usually produced at
the Théâtre Feydeau, it was nevertheless well received
by the public.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this came “La Neige,” a pretty score which,
however, the critics (who in those days were generally
literary men not at all competent to judge of
musical matters) declared bore some resemblance
to the work of Rossini. But at that time what musician
was there who could entirely withstand Rossini’s
style, which had conquered the universe, not
even excepting Germany?</p>

<p class='c007'>“La Neige” was succeeded by “Le Maçon,” in
which there occur at least two or three morceaux
that are marvels of wit and grace.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Le Maçon” was followed by “Le Timide,”
“Fiorella,” “La Muette de Portici,” a grand opera
in five acts, produced by Scribe and Casimir Delavigne,
which was represented at the Académie de
Musique on the 19th of February, 1828. It had
considerable success the first night and the succeeding
representations only strengthened the good
opinion formed of it. After more than sixty years
and in spite of certain features which are now
looked upon as old-fashioned, as well as an orchestration
which would better suit present ideas
were it more powerful and contrapuntal, at least
in certain parts of the score, this admirable work
would still be quite presentable anywhere. The
impartial public, which does not yield to the influence
of schools of music and does not hide its
impressions, would still warmly applaud in this rich
treasury of sweet melody the chorus, “O Dieu puissant”;
the barcarolle, “Amis, la matinée est belle”;
the duet by the two men, “Amour Sacré de la
Patrie”; the market scene; the beautiful and impressive
prayer; the delicious air of “Sleep”; the air
sung by the woman in the fourth act, “Arbitre d’une
Vie,” which has become classical; and that other
barcarolle, “Voyez du haut de ce rivage”; the
tarantella, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>The original and singularly bold idea of making a
dumb girl the heroine of a grand opera was received
at the outset with censure on the part of the critics;
and it must be admitted as a general principle that the
critics were perfectly right. Slowly, however, the
public became accustomed to this creation, and it
has now for a long time been admitted that the
rôle of Fenella is a mark of genius. The whole of
this part played in dumb show seems to be voiced,
as it were, by the orchestra, which renders in a
wonderfully happy manner and with extraordinary
dexterity the sentiments felt by the sister of the
fisher Massaniello.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the overture, it has earned public approval
in every part of the world where an orchestra can
be found capable of executing it. It is brilliant,
dramatic, pathetic, and the <em>motif</em> of the triumphal
march which constitutes the <em>allegro</em> is superb and
truly irresistible in its power to move the audience.</p>

<p class='c007'>Space would fail us were we to stop, even for a
moment, to speak of each one of his works, and we
cannot do more than name them. Yet their names
alone will sing in the reader’s memory those varied
songs, so <i><span lang="fr">spirituel</span></i>, so well suited to the works which
they designate that they have nearly all continued
to hold the musical stage of Europe ever since they
were first produced. They are as follows: “La
Fiancée,” “Fra Diavolo,” “Le Dieu et la Bayadère,”
“Gustave III.,” “Lestocq,” “Le Cheval de Bronze,”
“Actéon,” “Les Chaperons Blancs,” “L’Ambassadrice,”
“Le Domino Noir,” “Le Lac des Fées,”
“Zanetta,” “Les Diamants de la Couronne,” “Le
Duc d’Aloune,” “La Part du Diable,” “La Sirène,”
“La Barcarolle,” “Haydée,” “L’Enfant Prodigue,”
“Zerline, ou la Corbeille d’Oranges,” “Marco Spada,”
“Jenny Bell,” “Manon Lescaut,” “La Circassienne,”
“La Fiancée du Roi de Garbes,” “Le
Premier Jour de Bonheur,” “Rêve d’Amour.” This
last-named comic opera was the last of the long
series of the dramatic works of our author. It was
represented on the 20th of December, 1869, and
truth compels us to state that it was received with
some reserve. Quite the reverse was the fate of
“Le Premier Jour de Bonheur,” which obtained
a full measure of success. In this opera occurs an
exquisite melody that speedily became popular,
“Les Djinns.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rossini has described Auber’s talent in a remarkably
pithy manner. “Auber,” said he, “may have
produced light music, but he produced it like a
great musician.” So much meaning could not be
condensed into fewer words. Even so, Auber, in
spite of the slight appearance of his work, was one
of the most learned musicians of his time. But he
took as much pains to conceal his knowledge as
others do to exhibit theirs. His great desire was,
evidently in obedience to the nature of the man, to
be always clear, melodious, lovable, <i><span lang="fr">spirituel</span></i>, attractive
in every way; never wearisome. In this he
was perhaps wrong. Possessing as he did the
science of counterpoint and a wonderful dexterity
in instrumentation, he would have done well to make
himself, from time to time at least, more obscure,
mystical, symbolical and enigmatical, for in so doing
he would have risen in the esteem of the pedants
who affect to like only that kind of music which is
wearisome and to understand only that which is
incomprehensible. Such obscurity on his part
would have thrown into still higher relief the inspirations
born of his truly creative faculties, I
mean his songs and his <em>motifs</em>. Whenever he desired
to do so, Auber well knew how to rise to the
lofty and pathetic, and he could produce what is
called grand high class music. Let such as doubt this
read the fourth act of “Manon Lescaut,” and they
will be convinced that there was in the mind and
heart of Auber something more than dance music.
We have there grand and beautiful music, and I find
it difficult to mention any orchestration richer or
more impressive and more beautifully conceived than
that which occurs in “La Circassienne.” We have
only to read the many <em>solfeggios</em> that he wrote during
the long years when he was director of the Conservatoire
for competition among the pupils learning
the sol-fa system, and we shall find in these
minor masterpieces the sure hand of an eminent
and profound harmonist.</p>

Jacques François Fromental
Elias Halévy was born
in Paris, May 27, 1799, of Jewish
parents, whose family name was
Lévi. The same considerations
of expediency that induced Meyerbeer to change
his name from Beer to that which he afterwards
made famous, proved similarly potent with Halévy.
His father was by birth a Bavarian, his
mother was born in Lorraine. The former was
greatly honored among French Israelites for his
upright character and as a Hebrew scholar profoundly
versed in the Talmud. While yet very
young, Halévy developed such remarkable musical
precocity that he was sent to the Conservatory
when only ten years of age. He was at once placed
in the class of Berton, then in the full flush of his
triumph as the composer of “Montano et Stéphanie,”
his masterpiece. Berton outlived his fame, and his
music is now forgotten. It may be mentioned in
passing, that Berton was greatly piqued by the success
of Rossini, and published two acrimonious
pamphlets attacking the Italian composer. One of
these was entitled, “De la Musique Mécanique et
de la Musique Philosophique,” and the other,
“Epître à un célèbre compositeur Français précédée
de quelques observations sur la Musique Mécanique
et la Musique Philosophique.” Of course,
“la musique mécanique” was the music of Rossini,
and “la musique philosophique” was that of Berton.
The “célèbre compositeur” was Boieldieu,
who was greatly mortified by a dedication that identified
him with sentiments wholly in conflict with
those he entertained toward Rossini.</p>

<p class='c007'>Halévy prosecuted his studies so industriously
under the guidance of Berton, who was an admirable
musician, and progressed so rapidly, that one year
after he entered the Conservatory, he won a prize in
solfeggio, and the year following, the second prize in
harmony was bestowed on him. From Berton’s instruction
he passed to that of Cherubini, who subjected
him to a rigid course of counterpoint, fugue
and composition. Here again, he advanced with
such speed that at the end of seven years, and while
yet a boy of seventeen, he competed for the Grand
Prix de Rome, obtaining the second prize for his
cantata, “Les dernières moments de Tasse.” The
next year the second prize again fell to his lot, and
the year following, 1819, he reached the height of
his ambition, carrying off the Grand Prix itself for
his “Herminie.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This much-coveted distinction is awarded at the
annual competitive examinations of the Académie
des Beaux-Arts. The successful candidates become
government pensioners for four years, and as such
are sent to Rome, where they reside in the Villa
Medici, in the Académie de France. The prize
composition was, at first, a cantata for one voice
and orchestra, and after, for one male and one female
voice and orchestra. The prize was established
in 1803, and since then, a winner has been
sent, at the cost of the government, to Rome, every
year, except in those years when no composition
was considered worthy the prize. It is somewhat
curious that of the sixty and odd students whose
achievements and future promise won for them this
honor, so few attained to permanent fame. The
only prize-winners whose names have made the tour
of the world are Hérold, Halévy, Berlioz, A.
Thomas, Gounod, Bizet, and Massenet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before his departure for Rome, he composed a
Funeral March and a “De Profondis” on the death
of the Duc de Berri (1820), for three voices and
orchestra. He dedicated it to Cherubini, and it was
performed in the synagogue in Rue St. Avoye. In
Italy he devoted himself with his accustomed energy
to serious and unflagging study; wrote an opera,
which was not performed, and some works for the
church, which remain unpublished. At the end of
his prescribed term abroad, he returned home,
eager to prove to his fellow countrymen that he had
not studied in vain. He turned his eyes in the
direction of the opera stage, but experienced the
usual disappointments, in his early attempts to obtain
a hearing, and was almost in despair at the discouraging
difficulties that stood in his way. He
composed “Les Bohémiennes” and offered it to
the Grand Opera, but it was not accepted. He was
more successful with “Pygmalion,” which was received
and placed in rehearsal, but it was suddenly
withdrawn and never performed. An opera comique,
“Les deux Pavillons,” met the same depressing
fate. Halévy began to lose hope, when in
1827, and when he was twenty-eight years of age,
the Théâtre Feydeau accepted his “L’Artisan,”
which was produced in the same year without making
any very marked impression. It is an unambitious
work of no special interest, except for some
piquant couplets, and a well-written chorus. The
following year he collaborated with Rifaut in the
score of “Le Roi et le Batelier,” written for the fête
of Charles X. In the same year “Clari” was given
at the Théâtre Italien. This was a three-act opera,
and up to that time, his most important work.
Malibran sung the principal part, and for the first
time the young composer experienced the intoxication
of success. There is, however, nothing in the
score to indicate the Halévy of “La Juive” and of
“L’Eclair.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1829 he was appointed, at the Théâtre Italien,
to share with Hérold the duties of chef du chant.
In that year was produced, at the Opera Comique,
his “Le Dilletante d’Avignon,” a parody on Italian
opera librettos, which was heartily applauded, and of
which the chorus, “Vive, vive l’Italie,” was hummed
and whistled and attained to the honor of adoption
by vaudeville writers. His next work was “La
Langue Musicale,” which, despite some pretty
music, failed, owing to the silliness of the libretto.
In the spring of 1830, “Manon Lescaut,” a ballet,
charming in melody and brilliant in orchestration,
was produced with great success, and was published.
Then came in 1832 the ballet-opera, “La Tentation,”
written in collaboration with Casimir Gide,
and though it was well received it brought no fame
to Halévy. He had worked faithfully and indefatigably,
but as yet without winning the recognition
for which he so fervently hoped. Opera after opera
was composed with remarkable rapidity, to meet
with no greater prosperity than a <i><span lang="fr">succès d’estime</span></i>.
A one-act comic opera, “Les Souvenirs de Lafleur,”
brought him no better fortune. Hérold dying in
1833, and leaving his opera, “Ludovic,” unfinished,
Halévy completed it, composing for the first act a
fine quartet that was always encored, and writing
the whole of the second act. Still, the composer
failed to win fame; but the clouds were about to
dissipate suddenly and to display his sun at once, in
its fullest glory.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1835, “La Juive” was given at the Grand
Opera, and Halévy was hailed as a master composer.
The work was received with a frenzy of delight,
and in the wild enthusiasm it aroused, the
composer enjoyed all that follows recognized genius
and well-earned fame in the capital of France.
This work opened to him every opera house in
Europe, and a career of brilliant success. In the
same year in which this masterpiece saw the light,
he produced a work of a character so wholly different
as to excite wonder that it could have come
from the same composer. It is, however, no less
great in its way, and was no less overwhelmingly
successful. This was “L’Eclair,” a musical comedy
for two tenors and two sopranos only, and without
choruses. It is exquisitely charming, a model of
artistic skill and profound knowledge gracefully employed.
These works won for him admission to
the Institute, where he succeeded Reiche. Halévy
was then thirty-seven years old, and had reached
his highest point of greatness, for though he wrote
many more operas, he never again equalled “La
Juive” and “L’Eclair.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The year after “La Juive” was produced, Meyerbeer’s
“Les Huguenots” appeared and proved to
be an epoch-making opera. Its instant and enormous
success had an unfavorable effect on Halévy,
for he abandoned his own peculiar individuality of
style, and became a follower, if not an imitator of
Meyerbeer. Still worse, for in his eagerness to
compose, he was not particular in his choice of
librettos, and accepted any to which music could
be written. The result was a series of opera books,
mostly of a gloomy turn, that no music could deprive
of their tiresomeness or make interesting.
Under this unwise course of action he soon exhausted
his musical invention and became nearly as
dull as were his librettos. “Les Mousquetaires de
la Reine,” and “Le Val d’Andorre,” two fine
operas, must be excepted.</p>

<p class='c007'>His industry was astonishing, as will be seen by
the following complete list of the works that succeed
his two crowning triumphs: “Guido et Ginevra,”
grand opera, five acts, 1838; “Les Treize,” comic
opera, three acts, and “Le Shérif,” comic opera,
three acts, 1839; “Le Drapier,” comic opera, three
acts, 1840; “Le Guiterrara,” comic opera, three
acts, and “La Reine de Chypre,” grand opera, five
acts, 1843; “Le Lazzarone,” comic opera, two acts,
1844; “Les Mousquetaires de la Reine,” comic
opera, three acts, 1846;
“Le Val d’Andorre,” comic
opera, three acts, 1848;
incidental music for “Prométhée
Enchainé,” and
“La Fée aux Roses,”
comic opera, three acts,
1849; “La Tempesta,”
grand opera, three acts,
and “La Dame de Pique,”
comic opera, three acts,
1850; “Le Juif Errant,”
grand opera, five acts,
1852; “Le Nabab,” comic
opera, three acts, 1853;
“Jaquarita l’Indienne,”
comic opera, three acts,
1855; “Valentine d’Aubigny,”
comic opera, three
acts, 1856; “La Magicienne,”
grand opera, five
acts, 1858; “Noé,” grand
opera, five acts (unfinished);
“Les Plages du
Nil,” cantata with chorus
and orchestra, besides numerous
vocal pieces and
some music for the pianoforte.
Of all these operas
only “Les Mousquetaires”
and “Le Val d’Andorre”
survive through occasional
performances. The latter, when originally produced,
saved the Opéra Comique from bankruptcy, and ten
years later relieved the Théâtre-Lyrique from pecuniary
difficulties against which it then struggled.</p>

<p>CARICATURE OF HALÉVY BY DANTAN.<br>  <br>  From the Carnavalet Museum, Paris.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In addition to the production of this immense
mass of operatic music, Halévy was able to fill the
part of one of the principal professors at the Conservatoire.
In 1831 he was made professor of
counterpoint and fugue, and in 1840 he became
professor of composition. He wrote a book of
instruction, entitled, “Leçons de lecture musicale,”
which first appeared in 1857. It remains, in a revised
form, the accepted text-book for teaching solfeggio
in the primary schools of Paris. Among his
more distinguished pupils were Gounod, Victor
Massé, Bazin and Bizet, the last-named of whom
married Halévy’s daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1854 he was made permanent secretary of the
Académie des Beaux-Arts.
It was a part of his duties
in this office to pronounce
eulogiums. These he published,
with additions, in
1869, under the title,
“Souvenirs et Portraits,
études sur les beaux arts.”
They are gracefully written,
and are entertaining
and edifying reading. In
1861 the severe work to
which he had subjected
himself, began to tell on
his health. A southern
climate was ordered by
his physicians. He selected
Nice, whither he
departed with his family
in December, 1861. It
was too late, and moreover,
in the comparative
quiet of his new abode he
missed the excitement to
which he had been accustomed.
His debility rendered
work almost impossible,
and his depression
in consequence was painfully
intensified. The end
came March 17, 1862.
His body was taken to
Paris and buried on the 24th of the same month,
with great ceremony. “La Juive” was revived
at the Grand Opera in honor of his memory, on the
29th of May, and his bust, the work of his widow,
was crowned on the stage.</p>

<p>HALÉVY’S TOMB IN PÈRE LACHAISE, PARIS.<br>  <br>  From a photograph made specially for this work.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Halévy was a highly gifted man. In addition to
his genius for music, he had innate talent for writing
and was an excellent poet and a brilliant literateur.
He was acquainted with German, Italian,
English and Latin and also with Hebrew and
Greek. As a composer, though he was a musician
of rare talents, he wrote too much, too rapidly and
too carelessly, to do himself full justice. His two
masterpieces are almost immeasurably above any of
his other operas. In these latter, we meet, now
and then, with moments of great beauty, with
scenes of thrilling dramatic power, but they are in
the midst of much that is oppressively dull owing to
the rigid obscurity of style in which they are written.
He seems to have had so sensitive a fear of
falling into commonplace that he went to the opposite
extreme, even avoiding clearly marked rhythms.
His mannerisms were a persistent resort to the
minor key, a fondness for a soft pianissimo effect
on the lower notes, long held, to be regularly and
suddenly opposed by a loud crash of the whole
orchestra on the upper notes; unexpected and
violent contrasts in dynamics that are mere capricious
effects without any logical cause; prolixity
and over-deliberately following a sombre strain with
one of great brilliancy, and vice versa. In all
his scores, however, his fine genius is manifested,
and it is impossible to study one of them carefully
without becoming impressed by the vigor, the affluence
and the flexibility of his genius. He was
equally at home in the gloom of tragedy and the
gaiety of piquant comedy. In scenes of pomp in
which the stage is crowded with characters concerned
in some high festivity, he is peculiarly felicitous.
He was a master of passion in its every
aspect, and when he is at his best here, he never
sounds a false note. His characters are always
strongly defined, and no composer has left behind
him a more masterly collection of vivid stage portraits
than has he. He was essentially the bard of
melancholy, as his many exquisitely tender and
mournful melodies testify. One of the typical
characteristics of his music is its refined distinction.
His abhorrence of triviality was so keen that it
caused him often to go too far out of his way to
avoid it, and the result was that he overfrequently
fastened on his music a labored aspect that was
fatal to the impression of spontaneity in effect.
When he was less self-conscious, however, his music
flows with delightful ease, lucidity and naturalness.
His instrumentation is that of a thorough master.
He had a fine sense of tone-color, and his scores
are rarely overloaded. He was an innovator in the
use and treatment of wind instruments, and anticipated
many effects that have been claimed for
those who came after him.</p>

<p class='c007'>In “La Juive” the orchestration is, in point of
richness, originality and variety of powerful contrasts,
much in advance of anything previously
known in French opera; and his instrumentation of
“L’Eclair,” in its freshness, vivacity and piquancy,
was no less innovating, and notable in a lighter
direction. In “La Juive” he had a libretto which
is among the finest that were ever set to music. Its
tragic story is told with immense effect, and the
poet’s knowledge of the needs of a composer is
manifested with masterly ability. Halévy never
again obtained such a book. How felicitously it
inspired him, is seen in the first act in the impressive
reply of the Cardinal to Eleazar’s contempt
for the Christians; in the romance sung by Leopold
to Rachel; in the chorus of the people at the fountain
which runs with wine; in the magnificent chorus
and march which precede the brilliant entrance
of the Emperor, and ending with the stirring Te
Deum and the welcome to the Emperor. In the
second act, the Passover scene in Eleazar’s house
is full of interest in its Jewish elements, with which
Halévy, himself a Jew, must have been in complete
sympathy. In the same act there are the fiery duet
between Eudoxia and Leopold, and the other duet,
equally spirited and intense in effect, between Rachel
and Leopold, both masterpieces in their way,
and speedily followed by the no less splendid dramatic
aria sung by Rachel to her father, and in
which she announces her love for Leopold; the climax
of this wonderful act being reached in the
thrilling trio, in which Eleazar pronounces the curse.
The next act, with its brilliant pageantries, falls
short of that which precedes it, but has an immensely
dramatic, concerted number which culminates
in the anathema by the Cardinal. The fourth
act rises to the level of the second, with its noble
duet between Eleazar and the Cardinal, the tremendous
scene of the Jew in which he savagely defies
his Christian foes and welcomes death. The last act
is for the most part declamatory, and has no such
numbers as those we have named, but the impressive
dramatic intensity of the work is maintained to
the end.</p>

<p class='c007'>In “Guido et Ginevra,” he tries to repeat the
success of “La Juive,” but despite several fine
flights of genius he failed, not only owing to the
morbidly sad and dull nature of the play, but to the
heaviness of the music. He was more successful
with “La Reine de Chypre,” an essentially spectacular
opera, which, by the way, was analyzed by
Wagner in one of his Paris letters (1841). The score
is often brilliant and melodious, and it contains
some movingly pathetic melodies, but it is uneven
in excellence, and has pages on pages of music so
obscure in meaning and so dull in effect that its
interest is often impaired. Almost the same criticism
may be made on his next grand opera,
“Charles VI.” Moreover, by this time, Meyerbeer’s
“Les Huguenots” had been produced, and Halévy,
carried away by the enthusiasm with which that work
filled him, consciously or otherwise, deserted his own
marked individuality and became, to all intents and
purposes, a follower of Meyerbeer, at least in grand
opera. In his “Le Val d’Andorre” he became
himself again, for the time being, and produced a
lyric drama that fell little short of perfection in the
complete sympathy with which the composer identified
himself with the poet. There Halévy sounded
the very depths of passionate grief, in the music he
has given to Rosa after her lover has been drawn as
conscript. In “Les Mousquetaires de la Reine”
he produced a delightful score, sparkling, chivalrous
in spirit and full of beauties. For the rest there is
little to be said that would not be in the way of
repetition. His “La Tempesta,” written for Her
Majesty’s Theatre, London, was received there with
enthusiastic favor, but although there are some genuine
beauties in the work, especially in the finely
characteristic music given to Caliban, it has nothing
in it that entitles it to live. Halévy was greatly
piqued that the one melody most praised by the
artists, and that was hummed by everybody, was Dr.
Arne’s “Where the bee sucks,” which he had retained
for Ariel. With all his fecundity in melody
Halévy rarely wrote one that achieved general popularity.
The most noted exception is “Quand de
la nuit l’épais nuage” from “L’Eclair,” a charming
air, simple, chaste, and delicious in its tender grace.
He seldom, however, vouchsafed so unaffected a
tune, the harmonies of which are for the most part
confined to the tonic and dominant. The romance
“Pendant la fête une inconnue,” from “Guido et
Genevra,” is another morceau, scarcely less naïve
and delicate, that long survived the opera in which
it appeared, but it did not make the tour of the
world as did the other. His comic operas abound
in fascinating music which is buried, and must remain
so, in the uninteresting librettos that he so
thoughtlessly accepted. In that dreary book, “Le
Drapier,” there is a glorious duet, “Ah! devenez
mon père.” But there is not an opera of his in
which some perfect gem is not to be found. His
fecundity in melody is impressively exemplified in
the fairy opera “La Fée aux Roses,” of which the
score is affluent in charming music, sensuously
oriental in style, beautiful in local color, and of
striking originality in orchestral treatment. He
made an attempt to revive the enharmonic scale of
the Greeks in his “Prométhée Enchainé,” the translation
of which had been made by his brother. It
was a bold adventure, but it failed. It must be
confessed that it is monotonous because of lack of
variety in the orchestration,
owing to the almost
continuous use of wind
instruments to the neglect
of the strings. The
recitatives are noble, and
the chorus of the Océanides
is one of his most
classical and beautiful
compositions.</p>

<p>CARICATURE OF HALÉVY BY CARJAT.<br>  <br>  From the Paris illustrated paper “Le Gaulois.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Halévy, despite all his
industry and the fame he
enjoyed through his greatest
successes, made no
lasting impression on the
music of his day. Even
“La Juive,” notwithstanding
its power and its brilliancy,
found no imitators,
and “L’Eclair” still
stands alone, the only example
in its <em>genre</em>. It is
sad that an artist should
have labored so long and
so well, should have been
a thorough master of his
art, and yet have fallen almost
into obscurity thirty
years after his death.
A careful examination
of some of his more ambitious
operas shows that he
was, in some respects, slightly in advance of his time,
especially in his tendency to avoid purely rhythmical
airs in favor of what is now called “Endless Melody,”
but there is no likelihood that the future will
revive his works. It was his misfortune that Meyerbeer’s
star rose so early after the appearance of “La
Juive,” and that Halévy was drawn into the vortex
that the rage for the composer of “Les Huguenots”
made. If he had followed the example of the latter,
had written music to none but good librettos, economized
his talents instead of wasting them in a
reckless ambition to produce music; if he had also
adhered firmly to his own individual originality instead
of permitting himself to be unreasonably
influenced by the success of another, his operas
might have had a stronger claim than they have on
the favorable consideration of posterity. When Halévy
wrote “La Juive,” the time was ripe for a great
revolution in French
grand opera, and he just
escaped becoming an
epoch-maker at his art.
Meyerbeer appeared at
that moment, and to him
fell the honor that was just
within Halévy’s grasp.
Whether the latter would
have seized it if his rival’s
career had been delayed,
it is hard to say, for his
lack of discrimination in
the choice of opera books
was already deep-seated.
Saint Beuve says of him:
“‘La Juive,’ ‘Guido,’
‘La Reine de Chypre,’
‘Charles VI,’ are true
lyric tragedies on which
are the seal of beauties
that time cannot obliterate.
Some works, that
appeal more readily to the
tastes of the masses, have
been dowered with greater
popularity, but the decision
of those who know
is the only one that appeals
to a conscientious
artist, and of this, Halévy
received an ample share.
We think we are not mistaken in saying that as musical
education becomes more widespread, the popularity
of Halévy will grow.” This, however, is doubtful,
and it is more than probable that Halévy himself
felt that he had not wholly accomplished his mission,
for Saint Beuve, who knew him well, also says,
“It is strange that this estimable man, always full of
work, should sometimes have nursed a secret sorrow.
What it was, not even his most cherished and trusted
friends ever knew. He never complained.” Who
shall say that this secret sorrow, so silently guarded,
was not born of a sense of failure, or at least,
of self-disappointment! It is not improbable
that toward the close of his busy art-life he saw, with
prophetic eye, the fate that was to attend the greater
part of what he had composed; that he had written
for his own time and not for the future. Already
he has become little more than a name to nearly all,
except students of musical history. The works on
which his fame chiefly rests are seldom performed,
and the others, admirable as many of them are, have
gone into oblivion, and in all probability, never to
see the light again. That he was a master in his
art, is unquestionable, but it would seem also that
he was lacking in that highest quality of genius that
confers immortality on its possessor.</p>

More than a score of years have
passed since Berlioz died, in Paris,
that city which was the object of
his youthful dreams, the scene of
his bitter struggles and his sublime
defeats. It was in the midst of those Parisians,
who had accorded him little more than mockery
and scorn, that he had wished to die, weighed down
by sadness and discouragement, supported by a few
intimate friends and rare disciples. Moreover, did
he not foresee that sad end when writing the following
lines which subsequent events proved only too
true? “It was about that time of my academic life
that I experienced again the attack of a cruel malady
(moral, nervous, imaginary, whatever you like)
which I will call sickness of isolation, and which will
kill me some day.... This is not spleen, though it
leads to that later on; it is the boiling away, the
evaporation of the heart, the senses, the brain, the
nervous fluid. Spleen is the congelation of all that,
it is the block of ice.” Therefore death was for
him a blessed release. For some years before, there
remained of Hector Berlioz nothing but an earthly
frame, an inert and suffering body; the moral being
was crushed. The fall of <cite>The Trojans</cite> was the
rudest possible shock to that nature so well tempered
to receive it; hitherto the proud artist had returned
blow for blow; never had a defeat, however
grave, completely overthrown him. For the first
time, in witnessing the downfall of the work of his
predilection, the athlete had faltered. He had laid
down his arms and thenceforth, weary of life and
of the struggle, had contented himself with the
hollow diversions which the capital offered him,
“preoccupied solely with material interests, inattentive
and indifferent to that which impassions poets
and artists, having a morbid taste for scandal and
mockery, laughing with a dry and mirthless laugh
when this strange taste is gratified.” A certain heartache,
a vague suffering of the soul, vain regrets,
preyed upon him at least as much as bodily ills; his
shade alone wandered among us, dumb, taciturn,
<em>isolated</em>, and one beautiful morning in the month of
March it vanished.</p>

<p class='c007'>Berlioz’s militant career may be divided into two
distinct periods; that in which he struggles for position,
and which lasts from his arrival in Paris until
after <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite> and the <cite>Funeral and Triumphal
Symphony</cite>, in 1842; that in which, tired
of struggling without profit though not without glory,
he starts off to establish his reputation outside the
frontier, and to return afterwards to Paris, victorious
and triumphant; this lasts until his death. So soon
as he achieved a success abroad, great or small, “Be
sure that Paris knows it!” was the cry to his
friends. And Paris, being informed of it, had forgotten
it instantly. It was during the intervals between
these tours, when he came back to France to
see if his foreign successes had given him a better
standing in the eyes of his countrymen, that his last
principal works were produced: <cite>The Damnation
of Faust</cite>, <cite>The Childhood of Christ</cite>, <cite>The Te Deum</cite>
and <cite>Beatrice and Benedict</cite>, finally <cite>The Trojans</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was towards the end of 1821 that Berlioz came
to Paris, ostensibly to study medicine, but with a
secret longing to devote himself to music. He was
then nearly eighteen years of age, being born at La
Côte Saint-André (Isère), Dec. 11, 1803, and had
already received some lessons in music from the
poor stranded artists at La Côte. We are indebted
to Berlioz himself for the names of these artists,
which were Imbert and Dorant.</p>

<p class='c007'>On arriving at Paris, where his father, a simple
health officer, but a devotee to the sciences and to
medicine, had allowed him to come on the
express condition that he should follow exactly the
course of the Faculty, he set to work as best he
could to carry out this program. But one evening
he goes to the Opera to hear Salieri’s <cite>Danaïdes</cite>:
immediately music regains possession of his soul,
and he spends all his spare time in the library of the
<em>Conservatoire</em>, studying the scores of Gluck’s operas;
there he meets a pupil of Lesueur who introduces
him to that master, and he attaches himself with
much affection to the author of the <cite>Bardes</cite>, who
admits him to his class. At length he informs his
family of his settled determination to devote himself
to music, and he has performed at Saint-Roch
a mass which he burns almost immediately after,
saving only the <em>Resurrexit</em> which obtains grace in
his sight, at least for a time. He then took part
in the preparatory concours for the prize of Rome,
and was not even judged worthy to be a competitor.
Immediately summoned home by his parents, who
had no faith in his “pretended irresistible vocation,”
he arrived there so sad, so crushed, so misanthropic,
that his father, uneasy about him, permitted him to
return to try once more his fortune in Paris. He
came back for the winter of 1826, having nothing
to live on but a small allowance from his family, on
which he was obliged to economize in order to pay
back, little by little, a loan which a friend had made
him for the execution of his mass. His existence
at this time, which was shared by another student,
his friend Carbonnel, was a very miserable one,
their meals consisting on certain days of vegetables
and dried fruits. He gave lessons in solfeggio
at a franc a lesson, and even applied for the
position of chorus singer at the <i><span lang="fr">Théâtre des Nouveautés</span></i>.
But artistic pleasures counterbalanced the
material privations, and his heart danced for joy
whenever he could go to the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i> or to the <em>Odéon</em>
and hear some masterpiece by Spontini, Gluck or
Weber; his fourth god, Beethoven, was not revealed
to him till two years later, when Habeneck founded
the <i><span lang="fr">Société des concerts du Conservatoire</span></i> for the
dissemination of the works of that prodigious genius.
He continued however in the classes of Lesueur and
Reicha, so that he was able to pass the preliminary
examination for the concours of 1828. The subject
given out by the board of examiners was a scene
from <cite>Orpheus torn to pieces by Bacchantes</cite>, and Berlioz’s
music was declared by the judges as <em>impossible
to be played</em>. His only response was to prepare for
its performance at the concert to be given at the Conservatoire,
the superintendent of the Beaux-Arts,
M. de Larochefoucauld, to whom he had been
recommended, having placed that hall at his disposal,
notwithstanding the violent protestations of
the director, Cherubini. But chance favored the
self-love of the members of the Institute, for Berlioz
was obliged to give up his plan, on account of
an indisposition of the singer Alexis Dupont.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would have been strange indeed, if Berlioz, with
his ardent imagination and brain always on fire, had
allowed the romantic movement to pass by without
attaching himself to it with all the fury and passion
which he threw into everything. He soon became
one of the leaders of the new school, poor enough
in musicians, counting only himself and Monpau,
whereas it abounded in writers and artists. Like all
his comrades in romanticism, even exceeding them
all, Berlioz was an enthusiastic and constant visitor
at the <em>Odéon</em>, where some of Shakespeare’s plays
were then being given by a company of English tragedians.
Here he received a double blow; from
Shakespeare who floored him, as he said, and from
Miss Smithson who intoxicated him. It was to attract
the attention of the beautiful tragedienne that
he organized, with his overtures to <cite>Waverley</cite> and
<cite>Francs-Juges</cite> and his cantata of <cite><span lang="fr">la Mort d’Orphée</span></cite>,
a concert which she never heard anything about.
It was also this idea of reaching her through the
medium of music which inspired him to write his
<cite>Fantastic Symphony</cite>, in which he put himself in the
scene with his beloved, and which, in fact, was to
end by gaining him Miss Smithson’s heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>As these first attempts of Berlioz are little known,
it is well to specify them, if for no other reason
than because one may find in these forgotten pieces
the plan of certain pages of the <cite>Damnation of
Faust</cite> and the <cite>Childhood of Christ</cite>. His overtures
to <cite>Waverley</cite> and to the <cite>Francs-Juges</cite> were performed
for the first time at the concert which he
gave at the Conservatoire, in honor of Miss Smithson,
May 26, 1828; on this occasion he also had
played the <em>Resurrexit</em> from his first mass, in place
of <cite>The Death of Orpheus</cite>, which could not be given
owing to the illness of Alexis Dupont, a march of
the Magi going to visit the manger, and a grand
scene on the Greek Revolution. Finally, on the 1st
of November, 1829, he had his two overtures repeated,
together with his <em>Resurrexit</em> under a new
title, <cite>The Last Judgment</cite>, and a new work entitled
<cite>Chorus of Sylphs</cite>, the plan of which is as follows:
“Mephistopheles, in order to excite in Faust’s soul
the love of pleasure, assembles the sprites of the air
and bids them sing. After a prelude on their
magic instruments, they describe an enchanted
country, the inhabitants of which are intoxicated
with perpetual delights. Gradually the charm
operates, the voices of the Sylphs die away and
Faust, fallen asleep, remains plunged in delicious
dreams.” Everybody knows to-day what this adorable
bit has become.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime Berlioz obtained the “Prix de
Rome” in July, 1830, after having tried for it four
times in vain. He set out at once for Rome, first
giving, however, a farewell concert at which was
played his cantata of <cite>Sardanapalus</cite> and the <cite>Fantastic
Symphony</cite>, aimed at Miss Smithson whom
Berlioz execrated because of her ignorant indifference,
and who, moreover,
had not the slightest
suspicion of his mad
passion and frantic hatred.
The young composer
departed quite
proud of his success and
also of the sharp response
of Cherubini who
said, when asked if he
was going to hear the
new production of Berlioz,
“I do not need to
go to find out <em>how things
should not be done</em>.” He
stayed in Italy nearly
two years, in order to
conform to the regulations
of the Academy,
but it was time wasted
for him from an artistic
point of view. With his
just and profound distaste
for Italian music,
he was in no condition
to be benefited by it.
The only comfort he took was in fleeing to the country,
where he strolled with his new friend Mendelssohn;
but this companionship proved uncongenial and was
short-lived. He shortened his sojourn in Italy as
much as possible, and as soon as the director
Horace Vernet gave him leave, he returned to Paris,
taking with him an overture to King Lear and the
monodrama of <cite>Lelio or the Return to Life</cite>, a series
of old pieces worked over, which completed the
<cite>Fantastic Symphony</cite>. This work he could have
done just as well in Paris as in Rome; indeed he
would probably have accomplished more by remaining
in Paris, instead of strolling about the country
near Rome playing on his guitar and frittering away
his time.</p>

<p>MISS SMITHSON.<br>  <br>  Reproduction of a French lithograph portrait by Francis—published in 1827.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>On his return to Paris he felt a reawakening of
his passion for Miss Smithson, who had been temporarily
forgotten and patronizingly dubbed “the
Smithson girl,” while his heart was interested elsewhere.
At the time of his setting out for Rome, he
had thoughts for none but the young and attractive
pianiste, Marie Moke, whom he had known through
his friend Ferdinand Hiller; to her he had shown
some attention, finally declaring to her his uncontrollable
passion.</p>

<p class='c007'>This young lady had
coolly married Camille
Pleyel—a name which
she was to make famous
as a virtuoso—while her
mad lover, her pretended
fiancé, was in Italy.</p>

<p class='c007'>He made haste, as
soon as he got back to
Paris, to organize a concert
for the purpose of
performing in honor of
Miss Smithson, the <cite>Fantastic
Symphony</cite>, and on
that day (Dec. 9, 1832)
he experienced a double
triumph, since this masterpiece,
which she believed
to be inspired by
herself, deeply touched
the tragedienne and won
her heart for Berlioz.
Little did she suspect
that this composition
had been written with a
view to stigmatize her, at the time when Berlioz was
madly in love with Mademoiselle Moke, and that before
going to Rome he had it played in honor of
Mademoiselle Moke, as it was now being given in
Miss Smithson’s honor. Meanwhile, the families of
the two lovers made just opposition to their fine projects
for the future; but Berlioz and his fiancée taking
the lead, strove their utmost to overcome these
obstacles, and to tie the indissoluble bond which
was to render them equally miserable.</p>

<p class='c007'>During all these negotiations the English Theatre
of Paris was obliged to close its doors, and Miss
Smithson, who had assumed direction of it, found
herself without resources, not having enough to pay
the debts of the enterprise. To make matters
worse, she broke her leg while getting out of a carriage,
in which she was going about to organize a
benefit concert. While she was confined to the
house by her accident, Berlioz had the customary
“respectful summons” to make to her family, and
as soon as she was well he married her; “she was
mine,” he said, “and I bade defiance to every
thing!” The young household was not rolling in
wealth; the wife had nothing but her debts, and
the husband had but three hundred francs which a
friend had lent him. No matter, even a sad life is
not without its sunshine. Berlioz was obliged to
have recourse to his pen, and began to write for the
newspapers through sheer necessity, a thing which
he had hitherto done through love of controversy
and in self-defence.</p>

<p class='c007'>His first appearance in literature was made in
1829 in the <cite>Correspondent</cite>, with a pretty well
developed article on Beethoven, whom the artists
and amateurs of Paris were just beginning to know,
thanks to Habeneck and his <i><span lang="fr">Société des Concerts</span></i> at
the Conservatoire. He also furnished some articles
to the <cite><span lang="fr">Revue Européenne</span></cite> and the <cite><span lang="fr">Courrier de
l’Europe</span></cite>; finally, that influential paper, the <cite><span lang="fr">Gazette
musicale de Paris</span></cite>, which in 1881 ended a glorious
career of forty-seven years, espoused Berlioz’s cause,
and worked faithfully for his success. Shortly after,
in 1835 he allied himself with the <cite><span lang="fr">Journal des Débats</span></cite>
as musical critic, a post which he held for thirty
years, finding in its proprietors, MM. Bertin, staunch
friends and protectors. Besides giving him a comfortable
living, Berlioz’s articles served him at first
in establishing relations with the press, as much as
they injured him later by exciting bitter jealousy
and enmity.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was in the midst of financial difficulties that
Berlioz wrote the symphony <cite>Harold in Italy</cite>, inspired
no doubt by his own excursions in the vicinity
of Rome. In this he introduced a viola part for
Paganini, but the part was too much subordinated to
the orchestra to suit the great violinist, who desired
a veritable concerto with a simple orchestral accompaniment;
fortunately Berlioz did not give heed
to this demand. The performance of <cite>Harold</cite>
(Nov. 23, 1834) made Berlioz known to connoisseurs,
and soon after M. de Gasparin, Minister of
the Interior, ordered of him a Requiem for the
anniversary service of the victims, not of the Revolution
of 1830, but of the Fieschi outrage. This
<em>Requiem</em> did not reach its destination, but was performed
at the celebrated service in the church of
the <i><span lang="fr">Invalides</span></i>, Dec. 5, 1837, for the French soldiers
and General Danrémont, killed at the siege of
Constantine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fortune seemed at last to smile on the persistent
efforts of the young composer, when a failure came
to overturn his fond hopes. His opera <cite><span lang="it">Benvenuto
Cellini</span></cite>, written on a poem by Léon de Nailly and
Auguste Barbier, was performed at the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i>
Sept. 10, 1838; it was well sustained by Mmes.
Stolz and Dorus-Gras, but badly rendered by Duprez,
and disappeared from the bills after three performances,
the celebrated tenor not wishing to
appear in a work in which he was quite eclipsed by
the two prima donnas. Berlioz, in order to recover
from the effect of this failure, organized two Conservatoire
concerts, thinking that the performance
of the <cite>Fantastic Symphony</cite> would recompense him
for the loss of his rights at the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i>. The first
concert barely covered expenses, but the second had
a memorable result. Scarcely was the symphony
ended when a man jumped upon the platform, and
kissed the hands of the stupefied composer. The
next day Berlioz received a letter in which, as a
token of admiration, he was asked to accept a sum
of twenty thousand francs, and this letter was signed
by the enthusiastic listener of the evening before,
Nicolo Paganini. This sum—whether it was, as
some think, a secret manifestation of Bertin’s liberality,
or whether it was really given by Paganini for
the purpose of defending himself in the eyes of the
Parisians against an accusation of avarice—made
Berlioz easy in his finances for some little time, and
enabled him to work with an unperturbed mind.
He profited by the first hours of leisure which he
had found since his return, and wrote first his
symphony with solos and choruses, <cite>Romeo and
Juliet</cite>, which he dedicated to his official benefactor
and which was first heard Nov. 24, 1839, and then
the grand <cite>Funeral and Triumphal Symphony</cite>, performed
at the inauguration of the column of July
in 1840. He also wrote, about this time, a number
of songs or choral compositions, and the brilliant
overture <cite><span lang="fr">Le Carnival Romain</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The year 1842 was an important date in Berlioz’s
career. From that time his life was a divided one.
Misunderstood in his own country, disheartened by
his unsuccessful attempts to win the heart of the
great public, inconsolable for the failure of <cite><span lang="it">Benvenuto</span></cite>
which closed to him forever the doors of
the Academy of Music, he resolved to undertake
an artistic tour through Europe, and began with
Belgium in the latter part of the year 1842. He
met with rather more success there than in France,
though he was still the subject of heated discussion.
He took with him a decidedly mediocre singer,
Mademoiselle Martin Recio, who had made a
failure at the Opéra, and had managed to attach
herself to him. He married her later, soon after
the death of Miss Smithson, from whom he had
been separated; but he was no happier in his second
marriage than in his first; his first wife drank, his
second made unjustifiable pretensions as a singer,
which always exasperated him. After this little
excursion to Belgium, Berlioz determined to try
his fortune in Germany, where already some of his
works had found their way; from this time onward,
his life was nothing more than a series of journeys
through France and foreign countries. His first
grand tour was through northern Germany. At
Leipsic he saw Mendelssohn, whom he met on the
best of terms, forgetting all about their youthful
quarrels; at Dresden he inspired an equal devotion
on the part of Richard Wagner, who received him
as a brother and treated him as a master; at Berlin
he was no less warmly welcomed by Meyerbeer, who
recruited the necessary artists for him and enabled
him to direct a part of his <em>Requiem</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>On his return to Paris he organized, first, a monster
festival at the Exposition of the Products of
Industry, in August, 1844, then four grand concerts
at the Circus of the Champs Elysées, early in 1845;
but these gigantic concerts which it had always
been his aim to direct, brought him no profit.
Not discouraged by this, however, he gave grand
concerts at Marseilles and at Lyons, the modest
success of which was due partly to curiosity, partly
to surprise. After that he went to Austria, Bohemia
and Hungary; this tour was scarcely finished when
he rushed off to Lille to organize a grand festival
there on the occasion of the inauguration of the
Northern railroad. Finally in the summer of 1846
he returned to Paris, and after having given a magnificent
performance of his <em>Requiem</em> in the Saint
Eustache church, he decided to bring before the
public his most important work, <cite>The Damnation of
Faust</cite>. The first performance took place on
December 6, before a small audience. The solos
were sung by Roger, Hermann, Leon, Henri, and
Madame Duflôt-Maillard, who had no better comprehension
of the music than the public. The
second performance was given on Sunday the 20th,
before an equally small house, with a tenor who had
to omit the <cite>Invocation to Nature</cite>. This convinced
Berlioz that he was still far from having conquered
his own country. He departed for Russia, deeply
wounded by the indifference of his countrymen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of his Paris friends had clubbed together
to furnish him the means to go to St. Petersburg,
whence he had received some brilliant offers. He
achieved the greatest success there, with musicians
as well as with the public, and the fact of his having
formerly befriended Glinka at Paris had its effect
in enlisting sympathies for him in Russia. On his
way back he stopped at Berlin, where the <cite>Damnation
of Faust</cite> was given with little enough appreciation,
but where he received recognition from the sovereign
and the princess of Prussia. When he got
back again to Paris, crowned with laurels, and with
money enough to settle all the debts incurred by
the performance of the <cite>Damnation of Faust</cite> at the
<i><span lang="fr">Opéra Comique</span></i>, he worked hard to get the appointment
at the Opéra of Duponchel and Roqueplan,
who were talking of an immediate revival of <cite><span lang="it">Benvenuto
Cellini</span></cite>, of mounting <cite><span lang="fr">la Nonne sanglante</span></cite>,
etc. Berlioz succeeded in getting them nominated
directors, through the aid of the Bertins, but they
no sooner had the official notice in their pockets
than they utterly ignored Berlioz. The latter understood
that he was holding a restraint upon them,
and since, as he said, he was accustomed to this sort
of proceedings, he took himself off to London in
order to rid them of his troublesome presence. The
affair of the Drury Lane concerts, unwisely entered
into with the eccentric conductor Julien, terminated
in bankruptcy, and the Revolution which followed
in 1848 would have left Berlioz without a sou had
not Victor Hugo and Louis Blanc obtained for the
sworn disciple of the romantic school the humble
post of librarian at the Conservatoire.</p>

<p class='c007'>In August, 1848, Berlioz experienced one of the
keenest sorrows of his life in the loss of his father.
He went to Grenoble to attend his father’s funeral,
and in his Mémoires he gives a most touching
account of the sad visit. It was about this time that
his little <cite><span lang="fr">Chœur de Bergers</span></cite> was given under the
pseudonym of Pierce Ducré, at the concerts of the
Philharmonic Society, Saint Cecilia hall, Chaussée
d’Antin. In 1852 his <cite><span lang="it">Benvenuto</span></cite> was given with
great success at Weimar under the fervent direction
of Liszt, but the next year the same opera utterly
failed in London, where the Italians, said Berlioz,
conspired to ruin it. By “Italians” Berlioz meant
the orchestral conductor Costa and his party.
Berlioz had accepted the preceding year the leadership
of the New Philharmonic, and had made by
his success, and attacks, a bitter enemy of the leader
of the old <em>Philharmonic Society</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the Empire had
been restored in France,
Berlioz would have liked
to see reëstablished in his
own favor the high position
which his master Lesueur
had occupied under
the first Empire; but
all that he obtained was
the privilege of performing
a Te Deum, which
he was holding in reserve
for the coronation
of the new sovereign, and
it was Auber who was appointed
master of music
of the Imperial Chapel.
In December, 1854, his
sacred trilogy of the
<cite>Childhood of Christ</cite>, completed
and remodelled,
was given with great success,
and if it was performed
but twice, it was
only because Berlioz,—he
had taken great care
to announce it in advance,—was
on the point of departing for Gotha, Weimar,
and Brussels, where there was great eagerness to
hear this new work. He returned to Paris the following
March, and on the evening of April 30, 1855,
the day preceding the Universal Exposition, he gave
in Saint Eustache church the first performance of his
grand <cite><span lang="la">Te Deum</span></cite> for three choruses, orchestra and
organ. Afterwards when it became a question of
engraving it, Berlioz was able to see how greatly he was
admired in foreign lands, for the first subscribers were
the kings of Hanover, Saxony, Prussia, the emperor
of Russia, the king of Belgium and the queen of
England. The following year he published a final and
much enlarged edition of his excellent <cite>Treatise on
Modern Instrumentation and Orchestration</cite>, originally
brought out in 1844; he dedicated this work to
the king of Prussia. On the 21st of June, 1856, after
four <i><span lang="fr">tours de scrutin</span></i>, he was nominated member of
the Académie des Beaux-Arts, replacing Adolphe
Adam, who had refused to vote for him two years
before and had helped to form the majority in
favor of Clapisson. The following years were spent
by Berlioz in organizing concerts at Weimar and in
England, and above all
in the composition of the
great work on which he
built his supreme hope
of success in France, his
tragedy of <cite><span lang="fr">Les Troyens</span></cite>.
Since 1856 he had been
invited every year to Baden
by Bénazet, contractor
for the gaming tables,
to organize grand concerts
for the benefit of
the visitors. Thus when
the king of Baden, as
Bénazet was called, concluded
to build a new
entertainment hall, it occurred
to him at once
that it would be a fine
idea to get Berlioz to
write something for its
inauguration, and the latter,
from the first mention
of the subject, felt a reawakening
of the desire
which had been haunting
him for thirty years,
to write a comic opera, at once sentimental and gay,
on certain scenes arranged by himself after Shakespeare’s
comedy <cite>Much Ado About Nothing</cite>. He acquitted
himself of this agreeable task by fits and starts;
the performance of the work at Baden took place
three days sooner than he hoped, and the success was
great enough with that cosmopolitan audience, in
which the French predominated, to find an immediate
echo at Paris. The following year Mesdames
Viardot and Vendenheuvel-Duprez sang the delicious
nocturne which closes the first act. For an instant
Berlioz indulged in the hope that they were going
to play his bit of comedy at the Opéra Comique,
and in this fond hope he wrote two more things
and had them engraved; but he was soon obliged
to recognize that it would be impossible with such
a director as Emile Perrin, and so thought no more
about it. Besides, he was entirely occupied with
his dear <cite>Troyens</cite> and the production of this beloved
work absorbed his every thought. In 1857 he was
all in the heat of the composition; he talked about
his antique tragedy to M. Bennett, to Auguste
Morel, to Hans von Bülow; in default of the music
he read his poem at the salons, sometimes at M.
Edouard Bertin’s house, sometimes at his own, and
everywhere he received the warmest congratulations.
At a soirée at the Tuileries, the Empress spoke to
him at length in regard to it, and immediately he
proposed to read his poems to the sovereigns if the
Emperor could find an hour to give him, but not
until three acts were completed, so that they might
order the immediate study of it at the Opéra.
Alas, the Emperor, unlearned in matters of music,
did not respond favorably to Berlioz’s demands; he
took no notice of his poem, and did not give the
longed-for order to mount <cite><span lang="fr">Les Troyens</span></cite> at the
<i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i>. But while Berlioz was chafing with impatience
at seeing <cite><span lang="fr">La Favorite</span></cite> and <cite>Lucie</cite>, translated
by Alphonse Royer, played over and over again,
and Halévy’s <cite><span lang="fr">La Magicienne</span></cite> and Félicien David’s
<cite>Herculanum</cite> pass him by, the Emperor, through the
solicitations of the princess Metternich, opened the
doors of the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i> to Richard Wagner, and decreed
that his <cite>Tannhäuser</cite> should be given with
great pomp and magnificence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The blow was a cruel one, and Berlioz, beside
himself with rage and disappointment, attacked this
unexpected rival and his opera with a fury that
knew no bounds. He did not understand, unhappy
man, that his cause was closely allied to that of
Richard Wagner; the public, influenced by such
critics as Scudo, Jouvin, Lasalle, Azevedo and
Chadeuil, was equally hard on both of them and
classed them together as a couple of dangerous
madmen; no distinction was made between the two.
The fall of <cite>Tannhäuser</cite>, towards which Berlioz had
worked with all his energies, resulted in closing to
him the stage of the Opéra, and it also assured in
advance the unpopularity of <cite><span lang="fr">les Troyens</span></cite> with the
public ready to extol or condemn the two innovators
without discrimination. Moreover he saw Gounod,
Gevaert and many others gain access to the Opéra
in preference to himself. At last quite worn out
with disappointment, Berlioz decided to accept the
offers of M. Carvalho. This manager had just
reopened the <i><span lang="fr">Théâtre-Lyrique</span></i> and wished to make
a great hit in order to obtain from the government
a subsidy of a hundred thousand francs.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it was no longer a question of playing the
whole of <cite><span lang="fr">les Troyens</span></cite> at the <i><span lang="fr">Théâtre-Lyrique</span></i>; they
would content themselves now with playing the first
three acts, subdivided into five, under the title of
<cite><span lang="fr">les Troyens à Carthage</span></cite>. The first part of the work
Berlioz had published as <cite><span lang="fr">la Prise de Troie</span></cite>, but he
never heard it performed. <cite><span lang="fr">Les Troyens à Carthage</span></cite>
was given at the <i><span lang="fr">Théâtre-Lyrique</span></i> Nov. 4, 1863,
and scored a failure, although nothing particularly
hostile or unpleasant occurred on the opening night;
the poor author even entertained faint hopes of
future success. It was the cumulative effect of the
scornful articles in nearly all the large newspapers,
the ridicule of the smaller press and of the theatrical
parodies, above all the absolute indifference of
the public, leaving his cherished work to drag
itself miserably through a score of performances,
that disheartened Berlioz and killed him. His
whole life, indeed, had hung upon this last hope of
success, and with the conviction of genius, at the
close of the general rehearsal he had exclaimed with
tears coursing freely down his cheeks, “It is beautiful,
it is sublime!” He retired to his house and
lived there, taciturn, desolate, seeing only a few
chosen friends who tried to console him, and cared
for like a child by his mother-in-law; he had
buried his second wife (June, 1862) by the side of
the first, in Montmartre cemetery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thanks to the income from his compositions he
was able to give up his post of musical critic of the
<cite><span lang="fr">Débats</span></cite>, which had become insupportable to him,
and was made an officer of the Legion of Honor.
He had been a chevalier for twenty-four years, having
been appointed by M. de Gasparin in 1839,
six months before the performance of <cite>Romeo and
Juliet</cite>. At Paris he found some consolation in
listening to selections from the <cite>Childhood of Christ</cite>
at the concerts of the <em>Conservatoire</em>, and in seeing
people give serious attention to his compositions
and sometimes applaud them heartily, at the
Popular Concerts recently founded by Pasdeloup.
Only two or three times did he consent to go out of
France; once to direct the <cite>Damnation of Faust</cite> at
Vienna, whither he was invited by Herbeck, court
capellmeister; once to conduct the <cite>Harold</cite> Symphony
at Cologne by the invitation of Ferdinand
Hiller; finally to St. Petersburg at the very urgent
solicitations of the grand duchess Helen, an enthusiastic
admirer of his works. But on the eve of
his departure he learned of the death of his son
Louis in a distant country. It was a terrible blow
to Berlioz, who was devotedly attached to this son,
a frail, dissipated youth, always discontented with
his lot, and little more than a source of anxiety to
his father. He set out for St. Petersburg with a
broken heart, and though overwhelmed with successes
and triumphs, entertained and received like
a friend by his young admirer, the grand duchess,
he felt his health failing and his
strength leaving him day by day.
On his return he went south,
thinking that the Mediterranean
might have a beneficial effect upon
his health and spirits; but twice
while walking on the beach, once
at Monaco, afterwards at Nice,
he was attacked with vertigo, and
fell fainting to the ground. He
returned to Paris, and at the end
of two months believed himself
cured of these fainting spells, but
the nervous trouble increased
daily. He still had desire and
strength enough left to drag himself
to Grenoble in August, 1868,
to attend a musical solemnity at
which he was made honorary president
by his colleagues, who were
proud of him at last. This was
the end; on Monday morning
the 8th of March, 1869, Hector Berlioz quietly and
painlessly breathed his last.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Just a year later the conversion of the public to
Berlioz music was accomplished by means of a
grand festival at the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i> in honor of the master,
organized by his disciple Ernest Reyer. Even up
to this time it was possible to hear Berlioz’s music
only at the Popular Concerts, and then often in the
midst of confusion and protestations. The announcement
of this concert gave rise to many pleasantries,
and people agreed, with nods and chuckles, that the
best way to pay honor to such a man was to play music
as unlike his as possible. However, the festival took
place on the day appointed, with a program made up
entirely of the master’s works, and some of the pieces,
such as the <cite>Waltz of the Sylphs</cite>, and the <cite>Hungarian
March</cite>, caused the liveliest surprise. They had come
to laugh and they listened; they even applauded, and
better than with the tips of their fingers. This was
the signal for a reaction, and from that day the sudden
change of opinion was only intensified as the
musical public, who had hitherto tolerated only a
few selections, familiarized themselves with the superb
creations of this master and insisted on hearing
successively all his complete works.</p>

<p class='c007'>His wonderful <cite><span lang="fr">La Damnation de Faust</span></cite> in particular,
so little appreciated at
first, finally had an amazing success
and an irresistible attraction
for the crowd, perhaps because
the result was assisted by two or
three concert performances. But
there is nothing half-way about a
French audience, it has no lukewarm
sentiments, and it praises as
immoderately as it condemns.
Having once taken the stand, it
accepted and applauded everything
from Berlioz’s pen, and
when it had exhausted mere
bravos, it easily persuaded itself
to erect a monument to his memory.
First it was a question of
a simple bust to be placed upon
his tomb in Montmartre Cemetery,
then it was proposed to
erect a statue to him in his native
city; but Paris did not wish
to do less than Côte-Saint-André, and so it happened
that Alfred Lénoir’s statue of the composer
was erected in Vintimille square near the rue de
Calais, the quarter where he spent a long period
of his life and where he died. An exact duplicate
of the statue was erected at Côte-Saint-André
in 1890, and surely two statues are not too many
to honor the great artist of whom Auber said with
a little spice of wickedness,—“Yes, this Berlioz
is certainly worth something, but what a pity that
his education began so late.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To-day Berlioz is at the topmost height of fame,
and this renown he has achieved by one work.
To the whole musical world he is the composer
of <cite><span lang="fr">La Damnation de Faust</span></cite>, and neither <cite><span lang="fr">Romeo et
Juliette</span></cite>, nor <cite><span lang="fr">L’Enfance du Christ</span></cite>, nor the <em>Requiem</em>,
each a masterpiece in its way, has obtained
the widespread success of the first-named work.
It is singular that a purely orchestral composition,
<cite><span lang="fr">La Symphony Fantastique</span></cite>, should be accorded a
second rank in the general judgment. Strictly
speaking, this symphony and <cite><span lang="fr">La Damnation</span></cite> present,
outside the music written by him for the stage, the
quintessence of Berlioz’s genius. They are the two
poles between which his affluent inspiration oscillates.
In the former of these scores is to be found
all the romantic exuberance of youth; the fury of
a latent rebellion against discipline and yet wholly
master of itself; a dazzling wealth of instrumentation;
a poetic and delightful coloring. In the
other, of which the style is more varied, burst forth
a passion, an irony, a burning heat, a prodigious
intuition of the effects of vast numbers, a fantastic
raillery, a power of dramatic expression without
equal. It is none the less true that genius radiates
from many pages of his other works: the <cite>Pilgrim’s
March</cite> in <cite>Harold</cite>: the <cite>Offertory</cite> and the <cite><span lang="la">Tuba
Mirum</span></cite> in the <cite>Requiem</cite>; the <cite>Repose of the Holy
Family</cite> in <cite><span lang="fr">L’Enfance du Christ</span></cite>; the <cite>Night of the
Ball</cite>, and the <cite>Love Scene</cite> from <cite><span lang="fr">Roméo et Juliette</span></cite>;
the nocturne-duet from <cite><span lang="fr">Béatrice et Bénédict</span></cite>; the
love-duet, the quintet and the septet in <cite><span lang="fr">Les Troyens</span></cite>
are all bright inspirations among creations of the
highest worth, that met with great favor, although
the works of which they are a part had not the
power to win the masses as they were won by <cite><span lang="fr">La
Symphonie Fantastique</span></cite> and <cite><span lang="fr">La Damnation de
Faust</span></cite>. These last gratify the public taste (using
the term in its broadest acceptation) because they
are not merely concert music, but have a close
affinity with the stage, in the dramatic stories they
illustrate. I believe that the minute descriptive
programme which Berlioz has attached to <cite><span lang="fr">La Symphonie
Fantastique</span></cite> has been largely instrumental
in assuring the success of this work with a public
that mentally follows the imaginary drama, step by
step as the orchestra depicts the various episodes;
now melodramatic, now rustic, now loving, sanguinary
and demoniac. Such is still more the case with
<cite><span lang="fr">La Damnation de Faust</span></cite>. Berlioz’s work has certainly
benefited by the attention drawn to Goethe’s
poem by M. Gounod’s opera; the great mass of the
public knew nothing of the original when <cite><span lang="fr">La
Damnation</span></cite> was first heard by them in 1846. Nowadays
music lovers everywhere are equally well
informed on this point; they understood, from the
time that the opera was given, the meaning of what
was recited to them by Berlioz’s singers, clad in black
dress suits and white neckties; they filled in the
gaps in his libretto from what the opera of Faust
taught them; they compared number with number;
in fact, by reason of placing side by side two works
so widely unlike each other, they learned to appreciate
the warm, passionate and magnificent power
of Berlioz’s older composition. Thus little by little
this product of genius has forced itself on general
admiration as the model on which Gounod’s Faust
was planned.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is no exaggeration to proclaim <cite><span lang="fr">La Damnation
de Faust</span></cite> a work of genius, and it excites all the
more admiration when we know that certain numbers,
among others, the scene in which Faust is
lulled to sleep by elfins, came from the brain of a
composer only twenty-five years old, and appeared
almost perfect in the <cite><span lang="fr">Huit scènes de Faust</span></cite> which
Berlioz published in 1829, not being able to have it
performed, and which he dedicated to M. de
Larochefoucauld. This fine scene, therefore, dates
back to 1828, as does the beautiful song <cite><span lang="fr">La Fête
de Pâques</span></cite> and also the joyous rondo sung by the
peasants. In fact, not only the grand choruses, but
the shorter pieces, the songs of <cite><span lang="fr">Le Rat</span></cite> and of <cite><span lang="fr">La
Puce</span></cite>; the ballad, <cite><span lang="fr">Le Roi de Thule</span></cite>; the romance of
Marguerite, joined arbitrarily to the soldiers’ chorus
and <cite><span lang="fr">La Sérenade du diable</span></cite> are all fragments of his
youthful work that Berlioz retained in the score of
his maturer period and had the skill to combine
anew in several scenes of extraordinary poetic
beauty and richness of effect. How inspired the
pretty rustic scene into which he has inserted, judiciously
or otherwise, his admirable <cite>Rakoczy March</cite>,
written to gain the good will of the Hungarians;
the superb monologue of the doctor, introducing
the Easter chorus; the animated scene at the
Auerbach tavern with its bizarre songs and the
ironical fugue on the word <em>Amen</em>; the marvellous
scene on the banks of the Elbe with the fine appeal
to the demon; the delightful slumber chorus of the
spirits and the exquisite ballet of the sylphs; the
double chorus of students. Does it not seem that
they were all conceived, composed and written down
at a white heat and without a pause between them?
How fascinating and impressive appears the really
devilish serenade of Mephisto, the charming <cite><span lang="fr">Ménuet
des Follets</span></cite> after the ecstatic air of Faust, the archaic
ballad of Marguerite, the extremely tender love-duet,
and the grand final trio with its chorus of neighbors.
The last part is, from beginning to end, absolutely
above criticism. It opens with Marguerite’s sad
lament interrupted by the chorus of students and
leads up to the sublime invocation of nature; to
the fantastic path of the abyss; to the lovely song
of Seraphim after the furious suggestions of hell.
What a splendid culmination!</p>

<p class='c007'>Surely <cite><span lang="fr">La Damnation de
Faust</span></cite> is a masterpiece; but
<cite><span lang="fr">Roméo et Juliette</span></cite> is another
and should have enjoyed as
great a success. That it did
not is perhaps owing to the
fact that in Berlioz’s symphony,
vocal music has only a small
place, the instruments alone
translating the sentiments of
the characters, the two not
being in juxtaposition as they
are in many of the familiar
operas of <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>
by Gounod and others which
ought to have led to an appreciation
of Berlioz’s score.
The seven movements that
form this composition are all
of marked worth and are appropriate
to the strange plan
of the work. In the first place,
the prologue, imitated from
Shakespeare, and of which M.
Gounod, later, adopted Berlioz’s idea, presents a résumé
of the work at once complete, grand and delightful,
and comprises the fine verses that Berlioz,
strangely enough, caused to be sung by a Muse in
honor of Shakespeare and Poetry. The opening part
includes three incomparable numbers: the poetic and
piquantly agitated revery of Romeo wandering in the
garden during the ball; the love scene between
Juliet and Romeo, a masterpiece of orchestration;
the Queen Mab movement, a model of fantastic
airiness; also three numbers in the second part, the
funeral of Juliet, with its penetrating sadness; the
death of Romeo, in which Berlioz has given free
rein to his passion for descriptive music, and the
oath of reconciliation, preceded by a stirring recitative
and the noble prayer of the monk. These
are so many magnificent fragments, which, placed
side by side according to the composer’s design,
form a creation of a wholly superior order.</p>

<p>HECTOR BERLIOZ.<br>  <br>  From an engraving by Auguste Hüssener.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>After <cite>Faust</cite> and <cite>Romeo</cite>, comes the <cite>Requiem</cite>,—another
triumph; a romantic composition of the
first class, written with feverish enthusiasm by a
master who rather sought to paint a striking picture
to each line of the <em>Requiem</em> than to probe to the
literal sense of the Latin text. The <cite>Kyrie</cite> is the
least eccentric and the most
expressive number. The <cite><span lang="la">Tuba
Mirum</span></cite>, in particular, produces
a tremendous effect with its
four orchestras of brass; an
idea that Félicien David and
Verdi borrowed from this.
Berlioz has given to the <cite>Lacrymosa</cite>
a searching pathos.
Perhaps the finest movement
in the work to which Schumann
rendered such ample justice,
is the <cite>Offertorium</cite>. The requiem
ends with a <em>Sanctus</em> for
tenor solo, seraphic in sentiment,
followed by a beautiful
<em>Agnus</em> and a lovely, unfugued
<em>Amen</em>. It is fitting to bring
together, for comparison, this
composition and the <cite><span lang="la">Te Deum</span></cite>
written about 1850, of which
the finest page is the hymn of
the seraphim, <cite><span lang="la">Tibi omnes angeli</span></cite>,
that rises to a magnificent
crescendo and dies away at
the close on a long and distant chord of the organ.
The prayer for tenor solo, <cite><span lang="fr">Te ergo quæsumus</span></cite> is
equally perfect, and the final chorus is a majestic
number to which Berlioz has attached a brilliant and
thrilling triumphal march for the “presentation of
flags.” It recalls by the vastness of its proportions
and its orchestral massiveness, his <cite><span lang="fr">Symphonie funèbre
et triumphale</span></cite>, so much admired by Richard Wagner,
and of which the peroration, entitled <cite><span lang="fr">Apothéose</span></cite>,
forced a flattering exclamation of praise from even
the savage Habeneck.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <cite><span lang="fr">Symphonie Fantastique</span></cite>, to return to the most
applauded work of Berlioz, after <cite>Faust</cite>, is one of
the most bizarre eccentricities ever hatched in a
composer’s brain; but it is also one of the most
impressive. The first movement, <cite><span lang="fr">Rêveries-passions</span></cite>,
at once so sad and tender, is, however, excelled by
the <cite><span lang="fr">Scène aux champs</span></cite>, which soothes and charms
us with its peacefulness. It is the most inspired
movement of the symphony. <cite><span lang="fr">Le Bal</span></cite> and the
<cite><span lang="fr">Marche au supplice</span></cite> are aflame with the extraordinary
verve of the composer, who, taking motives that are
neither very striking nor very original in themselves,
develops them with extraordinary power, and with
such fullness that each movement attains an almost
incredible expressiveness. Though in the <cite><span lang="fr">Songe
d’une nuit de Sabbat</span></cite>, the <cite><span lang="it">Dies Iræ</span></cite> is burlesqued and
degraded by the mocking accents of the piccolo,
the tinkling of bells, the bellowing of ophicleides,
yet this last part produces an irresistible effect and
drags the hearer along in the train of the hellish
turmoil. In <cite><span lang="fr">Harold en Italie</span></cite> Berlioz pushes this
seeking for extremely varied tone-colors, and unexpected
contrasts, and curious surprises for the ear
so far, that he frequently falls into excess. The
fine <cite><span lang="fr">Marche des Pélerins</span></cite> has eclipsed the other
portions of the symphony, but the first movement,
<cite><span lang="fr">Harold aux montagnes</span></cite>, is full of poetic melancholy,
and the <cite><span lang="fr">Serénade d’un montagnard</span></cite>, breathes a tranquil
peace with which the fiery and tumultuous
<i><span lang="fr">Orgie de brigands</span></i> forms a powerful, nay, almost
exaggerated contrast.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the exquisite religious legend <cite><span lang="fr">L’Enfance du
Christ</span></cite>, and the graceful opera comique, <cite><span lang="fr">Béatrice et
Bénédict</span></cite> we make the acquaintance of a Berlioz
tempered by age and who no longer seeks to
“make a noise in the world.” The second part of
his oratorio-drama <cite><span lang="fr">La Fuite en Egypte</span></cite>, is universally
known through its delightful chorus of shepherds and
its lovely tenor recitative; there is also much charm
in the first duet of Mary and Joseph as they watch
over Jesus. The third part includes a powerfully
dramatic scene in which the fugitives knock in vain
at every door, followed by a patriarchal scene with
the beautiful phrase of the father of the family welcoming
Jesus, and the trio, with two flutes and harps,
of young Ishmaelites. This is music that delights
the world. It is the same with the famous duet-nocturne
in <cite><span lang="fr">Béatrice et Bénédict</span></cite>, whose beauty
dwells in the opening strain of Hero’s air, and in
the splendid andante, à la Gluck, sung by Beatrice.
What gaiety, perhaps a little forced now and then,
emanates from the mocking duet between Beatrice
and Benedict; from the trio of men and the trio of
women. What exquisite sweetness there is in the
<cite><span lang="fr">Chant d’hyménée</span></cite> heard from afar; what verve in
the piquant rondo sung at the close by the reconciled
lovers!</p>

<p class='c007'><cite><span lang="it">Benvenuto Cellini</span></cite>, a work that has never been
revived, is not one of the finer achievements of
Berlioz; in it we meet too many concessions to
the virtuosity of the conventional opera prima-donna,
but it is pervaded by a spirit wholly youthful,
set off by sparkling instrumentation. The trio
of the first act, and the sad air of Teresa; the grand
quartet in the Place Colonne with its different themes
ingeniously blended and strongly marked; the
couplets of Ascanio; the narrative air of Cellini; the
scene in which the poltroon Fieramosca simulates a
duel; the charming love-duet between Teresa and
Cellini,—here, indeed, are page after page of limpid
melody that delight their hearers, as did the opening
brilliant overture with the following long carnival
scene, which reproduces with extraordinary effect
the mutterings and rumblings of a crowd. This is,
in truth, the climax of the work. To this opera must
be joined the overture, <cite><span lang="fr">Le Carnaval Romain</span></cite>, written
later by Berlioz, and perhaps the most beautiful of
his isolated overtures. In any case, it is that which
has had the greatest success, eclipsing the overture,
<cite><span lang="fr">Les Francs Juges</span></cite>, even in Germany where it was
at first so much applauded, as well as the overtures,
<cite>Waverly</cite>, <cite>The Corsair</cite>, and <cite>King Lear</cite>, the last,
though so expressive, having never enjoyed equal
favor with <cite><span lang="fr">Le Carnaval Romain</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tragedy <cite><span lang="fr">Les Troyens</span></cite>, imitated from Virgil,
marked the return to first principles made by Berlioz
when maturity had calmed the effervescence of
youth and the ebulition of middle age. It was taken
up again in a moment of classic aspiration and shows
how much the teachings of Lesueur influenced him.
<cite><span lang="fr">La Prise de Troie</span></cite> and <cite><span lang="fr">Les Troyens à Carthage</span></cite>,
separate works, but performed together for the first
time at Carlsruhe in December, 1870, are of equal
worth and of a superior order. In <cite><span lang="fr">La Prise de Troie</span></cite>
the despairing appeals of Cassandra, the tender
replies of Corèbe; the fiery choruses, the ballet
music, of which the local color is so appropriate; the
epic grandeur of the benediction of Astyanax by
Paris; the excited joy of the Trojan people welcoming
the entrance of the wooden horse; the woe-fraught
prophecies of Cassandra. In <cite><span lang="fr">Les Troyens à
Carthage</span></cite> the peaceful songs of the Trojans; the
sublimely touching melodies of Dido; the caressing
responses of Anna; Æneas’ call to arms, and the
stirring orchestral scene of the royal hunt; the third
act, an unmistakable masterpiece, with its pretty
dance tunes, its quintet, its incomparable septet,
and its fine love-duet; the last two acts, with the
sweet plaint of the sailor, Hylas; the pathetic farewell
of Æneas and the splendid death scene of
Dido,—all prove that both parts of <cite><span lang="fr">Les Troyens</span></cite>
must be placed in the same rank as two great works
that blend into one perfect whole.</p>

<p class='c007'>Berlioz, in addition to his large symphonic and
vocal works, wrote numerous detached songs with
orchestral or pianoforte accompaniment. <cite><span lang="fr">La Captive</span></cite>,
which was greatly extended from the original
sketch written in Italy; <cite><span lang="fr">Le 5 mai</span></cite>, a magnificent
song glorifying the first Napoleon; <cite>Sara la baigneuse</cite>,
and <cite><span lang="fr">La Mort d’Ophélie</span></cite>, lovely works for two
female voices; a fine <cite><span lang="fr">Hymne à la France</span></cite>; <cite><span lang="fr">Neuf
mélodies Irlandaises</span></cite>, a youthful effort, inspired by
the poems of Thomas Moore; <cite><span lang="fr">Les nuits d’été</span></cite>, six
settings of poems by Théophile Gautier, are the
most notable of this class of compositions. By
adding to these the pieces collected to form <cite><span lang="fr">Lelio;
Rêverie et Caprice</span></cite>, for violin solo and orchestra; a
charming <cite><span lang="fr">Meditation religieuse</span></cite>, after Thomas Moore;
and a striking <cite><span lang="fr">Marche Funêbre</span></cite> for the interment of
Hamlet; we have enumerated all the works of
Berlioz, great and small, that are worth remembering.</p>

<p class='c007'>The true domain of Berlioz, that in which he is
really king, is the orchestra. He gave an extraordinary
impetus to the art of instrumentation,—even
after Beethoven and Weber, on whom he
leaned,—by his marvellous instinct for blending
the various timbres of orchestral instruments, by his
indefatigable search for new combinations of tone,
by his constant effort to add to the power and the
expressiveness of the orchestra in order to make it
translate the most diverse sentiments, thus giving
to his music a stronger relief, a more animated
color. The prodigious result was, that he almost
recreated the art of orchestration, opened a new
horizon to it, and therefore deserves the title of the
French Beethoven. Is it not also astonishing that
his genius, audaciously innovating in regard to instrumentation,
exercised an influence not only on
all those musicians who began their career after his
success was established, but on others who were his
elders by age and reputation, such as Meyerbeer, or
somewhat younger, such as Richard Wagner?
These two composers, not the least able of their day,
having heard the works of Berlioz at a time when
very few took him seriously, had an intuition of his
worth and from the very first felt instinctively even
more than Schumann, that it was necessary to respect
this young man gifted with such extraordinary
imagination.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Thenceforward Meyerbeer, one of those rare
musicians, be it said to his honor, who feel a concern
for other creations than their own, took a lively and
permanent interest in all that Berlioz produced.
Wagner, on his side, admitted to friends that he no
sooner reached Paris than he made a profound study
of Berlioz’s instrumentation; that he had since reread
his scores many times, and that he had often
profited by the works of “that devilishly clever
man.” Moreover, from 1841, he regarded Berlioz
as a musician filling a place of his own, mingling
with none, while loving, understanding, worshipping
Beethoven; dreaming perhaps to be German in the
hours when his genius urged him to write in imitation
of this great master; but unable to assimilate
French love of external effect with Beethoven’s
profound symphonic style; possessing a wonderful
fancy, an imagination of extraordinary energy; torn
between his artistic impulses and the tastes of his
fellow countrymen, whom he
wished to win; incapable of
asking or of receiving advice;
possessed of that virtue, rare
even among Germans, of not
wishing to write for money;
turning his back on all musical
triviality; eminently fitted
by reason of these qualities
and of these faults to create
great works, popular or national
as in the <cite><span lang="fr">Symphonie de
Juillet</span></cite>, the best in his eyes,
of Berlioz’s works, and the
only one which, to him,
seemed destined to live.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p>CARICATURE OF BERLIOZ.<br>  <br>  By Carjat.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The portrait is pretty, and
coming from the pen of
Wagner, is flattering enough,
save in its conclusion, which
appears somewhat absurd to-day.
But this amazing aptitude
for obtaining from an
orchestra more than any other
composer had been able to
compass, was exactly the
origin of the misunderstanding
between Berlioz and the public. Certainly the
so-called learned criticisms of the most serious journals
and the chaffing of the less dignified press,
contributed much to transform Berlioz, in the eye
of the masses, into a species of charlatan hungry
for fame and banging his drum vigorously to attract
the mob; denying him genius except for drawing
attention to himself. These slurs, however, would
not have taken a firm hold in the minds of their
readers if the adverse criticisms had been wholly
without an appearance of justice. In brief, with
what did they reproach him? of lacking melodic
invention and of replacing it by inextricable orchestral
tangles; of rejoicing in diabolical noise and
of entertaining a positive contempt for all music
except his own. Nevertheless, Berlioz was not
wanting in melody. His themes, when separated
from their complicated accompaniments, have even
a family likeness to the romanzas of 1840 in the
style of Madame Duchambage or of Blangini; his
themes, vocal or instrumental, have generally a
dreamy melancholy, which seem to recall his birthplace,
with its tender and tremulous songs so loved
by the peasants of Dauphiny.
These perfectly clear melodies,
whenever he was content
to give them simple
accompaniments, met with instant
recognition and success
from the public. Among
them is <cite><span lang="fr">La Captive</span></cite> in its first
version; also the tenor recitative
in <cite><span lang="fr">La Fuite en Egypte</span></cite>.
It seemed surprising that the
composer of these delicate
melodies should be the one
who wrote such complicated
music, and so the ignorant
were taught that these melodic
treasure-troves were wholly
exceptional with this troublesome,
demented and blustering
composer.</p>

<p class='c007'>What repelled the public
and assisted its misunderstanding
on this point, were
the intricacies of his deeply-studied
and curiously-strange
method of orchestration. In
carrying out the idea that by
the aid of the most varied tone combinations every
shade of meaning in a piece of music can be made
clear to the listener, Berlioz, imbued as he was
with the teachings of Lesueur, had a tendency to
overcharge the more novel touches of his musical
picture, in order to indicate the secondary details
with that distinctness which seemed indispensable
to him. From this practice arose confusion in the
mind of the inexperienced hearer, and produced
cloudiness in the music from which the dominant
idea could not be detached without an effort. On
the other hand he gave utterance to many noble
and touching thoughts with pathetic declamation,
poetic and richly-colored orchestration, and impressive
sonority; essential qualities in Berlioz that
are really wonderful and on which his enemies,
notably Fétis, were careful not to throw light. On
the contrary, they did their uttermost to discourage
the public from bestowing attention on these works,
and they succeeded only too well and too long.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here then is one of the causes that made amateurs
rebel, on principle, against the innovations
of this great composer; but another cause, inherent
in the soul of Berlioz, repelled timid people. It
was his spirit of intolerance and of exclusive self-admiration.
Carried along by the impulse of the time
and the desire to insure victory for his art theories,
Berlioz did not hesitate to attack the reputations of
the most cherished idols of the hour; therefore,
whether he wrote, or whether he spoke, he indulged
his natural disposition to exaggerate everything with
virulent indignation, and outbursts of mad enthusiasm
in support of the artistic faith that swayed
him. The public did not and could not understand
him, and irritated by his fierce aggressive
tone, held itself instinctively on guard against the
creations of this fighting innovator and stood ready
to pay him the price of his contempt for it. Between
a rancorous public offended by the disdain
this iconoclast manifested for its tastes, and an artist
who never exhausted the taunts he had in store for
it, there was always an antagonism, skilfully intensified
by the personal foes of the master and which
ceased only at his death.</p>

<p class='c007'>Antagonism is the true word, for Berlioz in his
vocal works at least never departed from the models
so dear to the public. In fact, so far as opera is
concerned, he remained ever the disciple and
admirer of Spontini and of Gluck, without dreaming
that he was destined soon to initiate a revolution in
this branch of musical art. Even when, at the
height of his own romantic fervor, he broke down
the barriers of the symphony, there always remained
in Berlioz an instinctive respect for consecrated
forms; and as soon as he passed from the concert-room
to the stage he conformed in the most ingenious
manner imaginable to the old methods in all
his works written with an eye to the opera house.
He was deliberately revolutionary in the symphony
only, and that chiefly in respect to instrumentation.</p>

<p class='c007'>With this creator, endowed with a phenomenal
genius in a certain way, the ideas regarding the
essential conditions of musical art were so unsettled,
and changed so often from one time and from one
style to another, that he would have been puzzled
to formulate them with any exactness. He emitted
fire and flames, he hurled curses and roared bitter
denunciations, but when it came to deciding the
ideal that an artist should follow or the absolute
principles he should adopt, he did nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>There exists a radical difference between the two
great musicians who have convulsed the musical
world in the second half of this century. The
later-comer, Richard Wagner, pursued a fully defined
ideal, a single problem, on the solving of
which he had long concentrated his thoughts and
all the force of his genius, viz.:—the fusion of
music and the drama. He kept steadily in this one
path and brought the music-drama to the highest
point it is possible for it to attain. Berlioz, on the
contrary, realized at one stroke all the modifications
that seemed to him desirable to fasten upon the
symphony and the opera. He did not seek an
integral reform, but simply wished to enrich each
branch of musical art with new descriptive and
picturesque elements. But while his flexible brain
turned now toward the stage, now toward the church,
or the concert-room, he did not deviate much from
the traditional forms, though he endowed them with
new and wonderful characteristics.</p>

<p class='c007'>Warmly romantic with Shakespeare, purely classic
with Virgil, who were his literary deities, he was
eclectic in literature as in music. The splendid
lyric accents of Gluck are not in full harmony with
the deep poetic and chivalric inspiration of Weber,
and the lack of resemblance between Spontini and
Beethoven is still more striking, yet Berlioz loved
them all. It matters not that Berlioz confounded
these masters in his religious admiration of them
and made for himself a double personality, repudiating
all rule and tradition when he wrote for the
orchestra and for the concert stage, and becoming a
pious observer of hallowed forms when he turned
to the theatre. In his <cite><span lang="fr">Les Troyens</span></cite>, the voice parts
are of a wholly classic purity while the orchestra
abounds in modern romanticism; in <cite><span lang="fr">Béatrice et
Bénédict</span></cite>, delightful inspirations, exquisite in their
poetry, are mingled with the conventional forms
that Berlioz mercilessly condemned in the works of
others: inexplicable vocal flourishes, repetitions of
words, outrages on prosody, the clipping of rebellious
words; all this by a composer in whose
eyes correct declamation was a fundamental essential
of song.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such was the composer Berlioz, such the critic,
and the critic was not unhelpful to the composer.
In fact, all that he was in France, all that he was
able to win, during his lifetime, he owed to his
position as a writer for the press and as the friend
of influential journalists. But he made many
enemies, less by the aggressiveness of his writings
than by his caustic wit. There was in him an
imperative necessity to tell the public his hates and
his loves, and if he did not always feel free to give
bold expression to the disgust with which certain
works filled him, he invariably let his contempt be
seen through his polished and even laudatory
phrases. At least, nobody was ever deceived. The
musician in Berlioz is impassioned, now tender, now
vigorous. It is the same with the writer. His style
is picturesque and incisive, sometimes trivial. Side
by side are exclamations of admiration and contempt;
quasi religious respect and genuinely holy
anger, all equally energetic and sincere—the word
and the blow. To appreciate this at its full value,
it suffices to select at hazard one of the collection
of articles published by himself in book form under
the titles, <cite><span lang="fr">Les Soirées de l’orchestra, Les Grotesques
de la musique</span></cite>, in which the humorist tone prevails
and <cite><span lang="fr">A travers chants</span></cite>, which contains his most
serious thoughts; the two volumes of letters published
after his death, <cite><span lang="fr">Correspondance inédite et lettres
intimes</span></cite>; and finally his amusing and fascinating
<cite><span lang="fr">Mémoires</span></cite>, in which he travesties himself unreservedly
and confuses somewhat the dates and facts. This
book is a genuine romance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Berlioz, bitter and unsympathetic as it here
pleases him to appear, was wholly unconventional;
he was the athlete constantly stripped for the combat,
and armed for the fight. How different from
the Berlioz seen in his profession and in society!
As much as those, who knowing him but slightly,
judged him hard and unsociable, so much did
those to whom his affections went out, laud his
extreme kindness and his tenderness of feeling.
He was not prepossessing in appearance or manner.
His esteem and friendship had to be won little by
little, in order to open by some means or other, the
way to his heart. He no sooner found himself
among friends, than his spirits rose and often urged
him into countless pleasantries. Nevertheless, even
toward these he showed the most variable disposition:
he would arrive sullen and morose, and then
without warning, would break into wild and infectious
gaiety, to fall just as suddenly into icy reserve. A
troublesome thought would suffice for this, and it
only needed an inopportune word to make him
intractable. If he chanced to be in the mood
for brilliant paradoxes or merry persiflage, it was
necessary to refrain from interrupting or opposing
him. In the heat of conversation, no matter how
serious, he loved to utter wretched puns, and absurd
verbal extravagances. These irrepressible sallies,
at which he was generally the only one to laugh,
were something very serious in his eyes. “Genius
is akin to madness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Berlioz, one of the most eminent musicians of
all time, perhaps the most extraordinary artist in
every way who ever lived.” Thus he was characterized
by M. Reyer in speaking at the foot of Berlioz’s
statue. He was, truly, an extraordinary artist in
every sense; apostle and sectarian at one and the
same time; one who conceived great things and
sometimes partly realized them; who was in turn sarcastic
and sentimental, emotional and passionate
almost to weeping; who nourished an intolerant worship
of his art and never knew moderation in his
judgments; who was gifted with admirable creative
faculties and opened new paths to the art of instrumentation;
who was in perpetual strife with the
pretenders of true melody, to whom he never
yielded; who aimed to be at once as noble and as
majestic as Spontini, as imaginative and as impassioned
as Weber, as sweet and as tender as Virgil,
as sublime and as trivial as Shakespeare, as grand
and pathetic as Goethe and Beethoven, yet who
knew how to be himself by force of will and loftiness
of genius. Berlioz had a rare grasp of mind, and
was keenly sensitive to the beauties of certain great
literary works, hence the “romantic movement”
in France deeply influenced him. With enormous
will power and bordering on insanity, he aspired in
his youthful dreams to be considered, some day,
the Victor Hugo, the Delacroix of musical art, and,
in some respects, his aspiration was more than
realized—after he was dead!</p>

Ambroise Thomas was born in
Metz on the fifth day of August,
1811. He was the son of a
musician and received his first
instruction in music from his
father. In his earliest childhood he developed a
talent for music and when only four years of age he
began his musical studies. Three years later he had
instruction on the violin and piano, for which latter
instrument he manifested a special gift, and he was
already an excellent performer on it, when, in 1828,
at the age of seventeen, he was admitted to the
Paris Conservatoire and became the pupil of Zimmermann
in piano playing, of Dourien for harmony,
and of Lesueur for composition. Kalkbrenner, then
in the height of his fame, took a great interest in the
boy and aided his study of the piano, while Barbereau
gave him lessons in counterpoint. He was a diligent
student, and one year after his entrance to the
Conservatoire he won the first prize for piano playing.
The year following, he carried off the first prize
for harmony, and two years later the Grand Prix
was awarded him; and when only twenty-one, he
went to Italy at the expense of the State, remaining
there for the prescribed three years, and studying
conscientiously. During this period he wrote a
string quintet; a quartet for strings; a trio for
pianoforte, violin, and ’cello; a fantasia for pianoforte
and orchestra; a fantasia on Scotch melodies,
for piano; six capriccios in the form of waltzes, for
piano; two nocturnes for piano, a rondo for four
hands, for the same instrument; six Italian songs;
three motets, with organ, and a requiem, with orchestra.
These works were all published, as was
also his prize cantata “Hermann and Ketty.”
They are now forgotten, but they were then evidences
of great industry and of a leaning in the
direction of what was most worthy in the art into
which the young musician had been born, and they
attracted earnest critical attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>He returned to Paris early in 1836, and at once
sought for a hearing at the Opéra Comique, the
first ambition of a young French composer. He
did not have long to wait, for in August, 1837, his
one-act opera, “La Double Echelle,” was performed,
and so favorably received that he obtained a
firm foothold at the opera house and produced there
“Le Perruquier de la Régence,” three acts (1838);
“Le Panier Fleuri,” one act (1839). In the meanwhile,
encouraged by his success, he aspired to
the Académie, and in 1839 produced there, in collaboration
with Benoist, La “Gipsy,” a ballet in
two acts. He also composed for the same establishment
“Le Comte de Carmagnola” (1841);
“Le Guerillero” (1842); and “Betty,” a ballet
in two acts (1846). None of these was successful.
At that time Auber, Halévy, Meyerbeer and
Donizetti were composing for the Académie, and
it was not easy for a young artist to hold his
own against them. Thomas had not neglected
the Opéra Comique, for which he wrote “Carline”
(1840); “Angélique et Médor” (1843);
“Mina” (1843), all of which failed to make any
favorable impression on the public. Discouraged
by the lack of success that attended his efforts, he
ceased to write for the lyric stage, and for five years
remained silent. When he was heard again it was
in “Le Caïd,” a three-act comic opera, which was
produced in 1849, and achieved a brilliant success,
making a tour of Europe. It was followed in 1850
by “Le Songe d’une nuit d’été,” in three acts.
This opera was no less fortunate in the reception
accorded it, and at once gave Thomas a foremost
place among the young French composers of the
day. Then came “Raymond,” three acts (1851);
“La Tonelli” (1853); “La Cour de Célimène”
(1855); “Psyché” (1857); “Le Carnaval de
Venise” (1857); “Le Roman d’Elvire.” Some of
these obtained slight temporary success, but not one
of them won the popularity that attended “Le
Caïd” and “Le Songe.” Again Thomas retired
from view, and this time it was six years before he
produced another opera.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1851 he became a member of the Institute,
and in 1852, Professor of Composition in the Conservatoire.
Up to this time Thomas had distinguished
himself as a fluent and refined melodist,
and by his piquant orchestration; he was also noted
as a master of musical comedy. Nevertheless he
had not yet been able to win for himself a rank
equal to that of Auber, and in French comic opera,
“Le Maçon,” “Fra Diavolo,” “Le Domino Noir,”
and “Les Diamants de la Couronne,” which had
been composed before Thomas went into his second
seclusion, still surpassed all that the latter had produced,
and survive to this day, while, with the
exception of “Le Caïd,” none of Thomas’s operas
antecedent to 1850 are ever performed.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1866 “Mignon” was heard, and Thomas at
once leaped to world-wide fame. The work had
an overwhelming success, and has been given in
every opera house in the world. Two years later
this masterpiece was followed by “Hamlet,” which
was equally successful in France, though it has not,
elsewhere, proved as popular as “Mignon.” On
the strength of these two fine operas he was appointed,
in 1871, to fill the position of Director of
the Conservatoire, left vacant by the death of Auber.
His other compositions, not yet mentioned, are a
cantata composed for the inauguration of a statue
to Lesueur (1852); a “Messe Solennelle” (1857);
a “Marche Réligieuse” (1865); “Hommage à
Boïeldieu,” composed for the centenary of Boïeldieu
(1875), and many part songs, among them
“La Vapeur,” “Le Chant des Amis,” “Le Tyrol,”
“France,” “L’Atlantique,” “Le Carnaval de
Rome,” “Le Traineaux,” “Le Temple de la Paix,”
“La Nuit du Sabbat,” some of which are works of
the highest merit, in their order. In 1874 was produced
“Gille et Gilleton,” a one-act comic opera,
written, however, in 1861. “Psyché” was revived
in 1878 with additions, but though the music is full
of graceful beauty, and was warmly praised, it made
no marked impression on the general public. After
“Hamlet,” Thomas did not bring forward another
opera for fourteen years, and then he made another
brilliant success with “Françoise di Rimini”
(1882), in which was some of the finest music he
had ever written, especially in the prologue and in
the fourth act. He was now seventy-one years of
age, and could well rest on the laurels he had won.
From that date until the present (1893), he has
produced no new lyric work, his only contribution
to the stage of the opera being a ballet founded on
“The Tempest,” by Shakespeare (1889), which,
though remarkable as the effort of a man seventy-eight
years old, was not destined to be numbered
among his successes. In fact, with this work his
career as a composer appears to have ended. He
received the grand Cross of the Legion of Honor
in 1880. At the age of eighty-two, he is still fulfilling
his duties at the Conservatoire, in which
institution he has worked many important and useful
reforms. He has improved the method of
instruction, has instituted lectures on the general
history of music; has founded an orchestral class
and compulsory vocal classes for reading at sight,
and has raised the standard of solfeggio teaching.
Not only this, but he has been largely instrumental
in increasing the salaries of the professors, and has
enlarged the prosperity of the institution until it has
reached a point that makes it almost self-paying.
Thomas has lived a wholly artistic life and has,
fortunately, escaped most of the severer trials
experienced by the majority of those who have
devoted themselves to that branch of his art which
has brought him fame and competence. He is
given to physical exercise, is fond of country life,
has a villa at Argenteuil and an island home at
Zillieo, in Brittany. He is not without literary
talent and his tastes are refined. He is an enthusiastic
collector of bric-a-brac, and rarely fails
attendance at any of the more important auctions
at the Hotel Druot.</p>

<p>Fac-simile autograph manuscript of an “Album Leaf” written by Ambroise Thomas.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Ambroise Thomas’ life as a composer for the
Paris opera houses covered fifty-two years. In that
time he wrote much charming music, but he never
developed any individuality of style, never wrote
anything so distinctively his own that it could at
once be attributed to him by reason of any characteristics
belonging peculiarly and distinguishingly to
him. His earlier operas, produced between 1837
and 1848, are marked by refinement of taste, and
graceful finish in workmanship. After that and until
1860 his method underwent a change, and he
sought brilliancy and piquancy, as instanced in “Le
Caïd,” and gradually warmed into poetic feeling
and deeper sentiment, departing, in the meanwhile,
from the conventionalities that Rossini and other
Italian composers had fastened on French opera
music. His growth in his art has been steady from
the very outset, but if he has ceased to write after
“Le Roman d’Elvire,” which ended this period of
his musical development, his fame as a composer
would hardly have survived down to the present
time. From the opera just named to “Mignon”
was an enormous stride, and the brilliant reputation
this work made for him was sustained by “Hamlet”
and “Françoise di Rimini.” But even these, his
masterpieces, do not present him in the light of a
composer who had something to say that had not
been said before. His art evolution had enlarged
his method of thought and had enabled him to give
a wider scope to his talents, but it had not endowed
him with a style that set him apart from other composers.
We hear of the style of Auber, and it
brings a clear idea of a strongly marked musical
individuality to our mind. The same may be said
of the style of Meyerbeer and also that of Gounod;
but to speak of the style of Thomas would be to
convey no such distinct and instant suggestion of a
definite and an unmistakable originality, like that
which pertains essentially to Bizet.</p>

<p class='c007'>The music of Thomas is always polished and
delicate; his operas show that he has an innate
feeling for dramatic effect; his musical comedies
are models for the intimate blending of music with
the spirit of the words and the stage situations. His
harmonies are rich and flowing, and impart to his
work a decided air of refined elegance. His instrumentation
emphasizes convincingly his thorough
mastery over the resources of the modern orchestra
and a sensitive appreciation of the characteristic
tone-color of the different instruments. His scores
are never overloaded, and as the rule the right touch
is always put by him in the right place. The voice
is never overwhelmed by the orchestra. With all
these merits he is rarely if ever emphatic, and
strength and intensity of passion are not among his
musical gifts. Love, melancholy, gaiety and poetic
tenderness are the sentiments in which he excels.
Fire, and a vigorous sweep of emotional feeling are
not within his power to depict. The changes in the
style of his scores are the changes that the varying
musical tastes of the times brought about. He
never formed these tastes, but he invariably followed
them. His earlier operas are in the vein of
Auber or of Rossini, sometimes of both in combination.
When the fashion of the day called for more
dramatic expression he followed in the footsteps of
Halévy. Later, when brilliancy, tunefulness and
graceful commonplace were the vogue, he had no
scruple against modelling himself on Clapisson.
It was not until Gounod had risen into fame and
“Faust” became the rage, filling the music-loving
world with delight, that Thomas found it possible
to write “Mignon” and “Hamlet,” in both
which operas the influence of the younger composer
is shown on almost every page. Thomas has not
the gift of originality, but he has the gift of receptivity
and the faculty of assimilation largely developed.
Twice he went into seclusion, and each
time when he reappeared it was with a style in harmony
with that of the favorite opera composers of
the hour. There is nothing culpable in this, for
it proves conclusively, that Thomas was always
an untiring student. It is undeniable, that on every
occasion his style underwent a radical change,
it showed an advance in the broader and more
impressive essentials of his art, and added to the
fame of the composer. The works in which he will
live are those which belong to his last period.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Not so with his greater confrère Halévy, whose
first grand successes, “La Juive” and “L’Eclair,”
were his only masterpieces. Thomas has not
reached the height to which Halévy soared in either
of these operas. “Mignon” and “Hamlet” are,
however, works of no common order. The former
has won a place in the repertory of every opera
house in Europe. There is much of genuine poetic
feeling in the music, and the score, as a whole, is
distinguished by grace, melodiousness, delicacy of
taste, and that effect of spontaneity that is understood
as inspiration. Fine discrimination has been
shown in giving each character its appropriate
musical expression, and the skill with which the
people of the story are contrasted cannot be too
warmly praised. The “Connais-tu le pays,” the
“swallow” duet, the prayer of Mignon, the romance
of Wilhelm, the polonaise of Felina, have become
justly celebrated. The orchestration is exquisite in
its delicate finish and its ingeniously varied but
always artistic color. That it has achieved a permanent
place on the opera stage is beyond question.
“Hamlet” is more ambitious, and though not without
a certain nobility of style, is little else than a more
elaborate “Mignon.” In it the composer says
nothing that he has not already said in the last-named
work, the only change being a somewhat
more earnest method of expression. In this opera
it was claimed that Thomas “has indicated to
young composers the line at which the new school
should stop, under penalty of exceeding the bounds
of lyric art”; but Thomas, though undoubtedly
a musician of talent, knowledge and experience,
has never shown such originality as to entitle him
to be considered a reformer, and as yet there has
not been, even in his own country, any propaganda
to spread a knowledge of him through the world.
“Hamlet” may be considered the extreme point
that French grand opera had reached in the direction
of the Wagnerian music-drama up to the time
that it appeared. The Gounod influence is still
clearly apparent in it, but the Wagner influence also
makes itself felt in the effort to break away
from conventional models and to substitute expressive
declamation for more rhythmical melody.
The mad song of Ophelia is, perhaps, the most
effective number in the opera. “Françoise de
Rimini” went a step further than did “Hamlet”
toward a predetermined departure from the old
school of operatic music to the new. The composer
authorized the statement that the prologue to the
work would be a profession of musical faith, which
he had long contemplated and in which he would
mark definitely how closely symphonic music can be
allied with the lyric drama; after which the curtain
was to rise on music essentially “theatrical,” or, if a
better word should be demanded, “human.” The
prologue is certainly as strong and masterly, but it
has in it nothing of a symphonic quality, and, as a
profession of faith, proved to be of no permanent
value save as an evidence of the highest point which
the composer’s musical development had reached.
This portion of the opera and the fourth act are
by far the finest achievements of Thomas. The
orchestra through the whole opera is treated with
consummate power, notably in the beautiful effects
obtained by unaccustomed groupings of the different
instruments. In the ingenious blendings of tone-color
that are produced by combining widely varying
timbres with a skill as profound as felicitous; the
richness, ripeness, and perfection of the scoring
generally; as well as the masterly discretion observed
in maintaining a judicious balance between the
orchestra and the singers, the score may be justly
given a place among the most masterly that modern
musical art has produced. For the rest, despite
some splendid dramatic moments in the work and
the faultless finish of its workmanship as a whole,
it is to be doubted if it will live. But how few works
do live! Many glorious operas have been written
since “Don Giovanni” and “Fidelio” saw the
light, and yet not one has appeared that has yet
been accorded a place by their side. Hundreds of
operas that met with a brilliant and deserved success
in their day, have fallen gradually into the background;
operas by Spontini, who, in “La Vestale,”
just escaped producing an immortal masterpiece;
by Cherubini, whose “Les Deux Journées” came
nearer winning the third place than any opera
since; by Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi, Meyerbeer,
whose “Les Huguenots” is his only work
that bids fair to survive; by Weber, whose “Der
Freischütz” alone promises to last. The supreme
operas of the world might be named on the fingers
of one hand. Mention of Wagner has been avoided
because he is yet to experience the test of time,—that
incorruptible and most pitiless of critics. It is
the fate of some admirable and justly honored composers
to learn their ultimate reputation with
posterity during their lifetime. Among these, we
think, is Ambroise Thomas, and that reputation will
include respectful consideration for an eminent and
able musician, who constantly grew in his art;
while it will accord him a prominent place in the
ranks of wholly estimable opera composers of the
second order.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Alexandre César Léopold
Bizet was born in Paris, Oct.
25th, 1838. His godfather called
him “Georges,” and as “Georges,”
Bizet is known to the world at
large.</p>

<p class='c007'>The father of Bizet was an artisan, who, at the age
of twenty-five, studied music, and became a teacher
of singing. He outlived his son. The mother was
a sister of the wife of Delsarte. She was a pianist
of ability, a “first prize” of the Conservatory. From
her Bizet learned the alphabet and musical notation.
From his father he learned the use of the pianoforte,
and the elements of harmony.</p>

<p class='c007'>The boy did not wish to be a musician; he hankered
after the literary life. “When I was a child,”
Bizet told Gallet, “they hid my books to keep me
from abandoning music for literature.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Although he was not of the required age, Bizet
passed brilliantly, in his tenth year, the entrance-examination
of the Conservatory, where he studied
the pianoforte under Marmontel, the organ under
Benoist, counterpoint and fugue under Zimmermann;
and after the death of the latter, he studied
composition under Halévy. He won a prize before
he was eleven years old, the first of many prizes:—</p>

<p class='c007'>First solfeggio prize (1849); second pianoforte
prize (1851), and the first pianoforte prize (1852);
first “accessit d’orgue” (1853), second prize
(1854), first prize (1855); second prize in fugue
(1854), first prize (1855); second “grand prix de
Rome” of the Institute (1856), and first “grand
prix” (1857).</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1856 Offenbach, manager of the Bouffes-Parisiens,
proposed a competition in operetta. The
libretto was “Doctor Miracle.” Seventy-eight composers
appeared; six were found worthy, and the
prizes was awarded <i><span lang="fr">ex aequo</span></i>, to Bizet and Lecocq.
The music of the latter was first heard April 8th,
1857; the music of Bizet was heard April 9th. The
public was impartially cold.</p>

<p class='c007'>Toward the end of 1857 Bizet started on his journey
to Rome. He journeyed leisurely, and entered
the city Jan. 28, 1858. It was in 1859 that he sent,
according to rule, a composition to the “Académie
des Beaux-Arts”; it was not a mass however; it was
an operetta in Italian: “Don Procopio,” in two acts.
The reviewer, Ambroise Thomas, praised the ease,
the brilliancy, “the fresh and bold style” of the
composer, and he deplored the fact that Bizet had
not given his attention to a work of religious character.
The score of this operetta is lost. In 1859
Bizet traveled in Italy and obtained permission to
remain in Rome during the one year, that, according
to tradition, should be spent in Germany. He sent to
the Académie “Vasco de Gama,” a descriptive orchestral
composition with choruses; three numbers
of an orchestral suite; and, if Pougin is correct, an
operetta in one act, “La Guzla de l’Emir”; but Pigot
claims that this latter work was not begun until after
the return to Paris.</p>

<p class='c007'>He returned and found his mother on her deathbed.
He was without means, without employment;
and he was crushed by the death of the one for
whom he was eager to work day and night. He
once wrote to her from Rome, “100,000 francs, the
sum is nothing! Two successes at the Opéra Comique!
I wish to love you always with all my soul,
and to be always as to-day the most loving of sons.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was a “prix de Rome,”—too often an honor
that brings with it no substantial reward. He was
a “prix de Rome,” as was the unfortunate described
by Legouvé:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Listen to the wretched plight</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a melancholy man,</div>
      <div class='line'>A young man of sixty years,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom they call ‘un prix de Rome.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Burning with desire to write for the operatic stage,
he gave music lessons. Dreaming of dramatic situations
and grand finales, he made pianoforte arrangements
of airs from operas written by others.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Count Walewski granted Carvalho, the manager
of the Théâtre-Lyrique, a subsidy of 100,000
francs, on the condition that an important work by
a “prix de Rome” should be produced each year.
Bizet was the first to profit thereby. He wrote the
music for “The Pearl Fishers.” The text was by
Carré and Cormon, and the opera was produced
with gorgeous scenic setting, Sept. 30, 1863. The
opera was given eighteen times, and it was not sung
again in Paris until 1889, at the Gaité, and in Italian,
with Calvé and Talazac, when it was only heard
six times.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is stated in Pigot’s “Bizet et son Œuvre” that
Blau and Gallet wrote a libretto, “Ivan, the Terrible,”
which was set to music by Bizet in the style
of Verdi. Gallet says that neither he nor Blau
wrote a word of such a libretto.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1866 Bizet worked at the orchestral composition
which three years later was played at a Concert
Pasdeloup and was then called “Souvenirs de
Rome”; he temporarily abandoned it on the receipt
of a libretto by Saint-Georges and Adenis,
founded on Sir Walter Scott’s “The Fair Maid of
Perth.” While he composed the music of this
opera, he supported himself by giving lessons, correcting
proofs, arranging dance music for orchestra,
and writing songs. He often worked fifteen or sixteen
hours a day. His letters of this year end with
one and the same cry: “I must make my living.”
This pursuit of a living brought early death.</p>

<p class='c007'>The score of “The Fair Maid of Perth” was finished
in six months, but the opera was not produced
at the Théâtre-Lyrique until the 26th of
December, 1867. There were twenty-one representations.
In 1890 there were eleven representations
at the Eden Theatre (Théâtre-Lyrique).</p>

<p class='c007'>It was in 1867 that Bizet wrote the first act of
“Malbrough,” an opérette bouffe, which was given
at the Athénée. In 1868 or 1869 he wrote the
music of an opérette-vaudeville, “Sol-si-ré-pif-pan,”
for the Menus-Plaisirs, and he did not sign the
score.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was also in 1867 that he appeared as a writer on
musical subjects. His first and last article was published
in the first number of the Revue Nationale,
Aug. 3rd. His pseudonym was “Gaston de Betzi.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And then Bizet busied himself in the completion
of “Noah,” a biblical opera left unfinished by Halévy;
in arranging operas for pianoforte solo; in
original compositions for the pianoforte, as his
“chromatic variations.” He wrote music for the
text of “The Cup of the King of Thule”; he called
it “wretched stuff” and destroyed it. His “Souvenir
de Rome, fantaisie symphonique” was
played at a Concert Populaire in 1869. In that
same year, June 3rd, he was married to Geneviève
Halévy, the daughter of the composer. After the
invasion of France, Bizet served in the National
Guard, and his letters during those bloody days reveal
the depth of his patriotism and his disgust at
the incompetence and corruption in high places.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1872 (May 22) a little work in one act was
brought out at the Opéra Comique. It was called
“Djamileh”; the text was by Gallet, the music was
by Bizet. It was given ten or eleven times; and
Saint-Saëns, infuriated at the Parisian public, wrote
biting verses:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The ruminating bourgeois, pot-bellied and ugly,
sits in his narrow stall, regretting separation from
his kind; he half-opens a glassy eye, munches a
bon-bon, then sleeps again, thinking that the orchestra
is a-tuning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Carvalho, manager of the Vaudeville, dreamed of
reviving the melodrama. He first caught his playwright,
Daudet; he secured Bizet as the musician;
the result was “L’Arlésienne,” which was first produced
Oct. 1, 1872. The music included twenty-four
numbers, orchestral and choral. The score
was designed for the particular orchestra of the
Vaudeville. Bizet rearranged for full orchestra the
numbers that make up the Suite No. 1, and the
Suite was first played at a Concert Populaire Nov.
10, 1872. He also revised the other numbers, and
the revision was used at the revivals at the Odéon
in 1885 and 1887. The Suite No. 2 was arranged
by Ernest Guiraud.</p>

<p class='c007'>The overture, “Patrie,” was first played at a
Concert Populaire in February, 1874. Bizet experimented
with texts suggested for an opéra comique;
he finally chose “Carmen,” the text of
which was drawn by Meilhac and Halévy from a
tale by Merimée. The opera was produced at the
Opéra Comique, March 3, 1875, with the following
cast: Carmen, Galli-Marié; Micaëla, Marguerite
Chapuis; Don Jose, Lhérie; Escamillo, Bouhy. It
was about this time that Bizet was decorated with
the red ribbon of the Legion of Honor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Carmen” was no more successful than its predecessors.
Bizet mourned its failure. For some
time he had fought bravely against melancholy. At
the age of thirty-six, he exclaimed, “It is extraordinary
that I should feel so old.” Attacks of angina
had been periodical for some years. He would jest
at his suffering: “Fancy a double-pedal, A flat, E
flat, which goes through your head from ear to ear.”
He had abused his strength by over-work. Suddenly,
at midnight, he died in Bougival, where he
was resting. It was June 3rd, three months after
the first performance of “Carmen.” The widow
was left with a five-year-old son.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Bizet left few manuscripts. He burned many
shortly before his death. The fragments of “Don
Rodrigue” and “Clarisse Harlowe” were left in a
curious notation that is nearly hieroglyphical, not to
be deciphered.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Louis Gallet first met Bizet, he saw a forest
of blonde hair, thick and curly, which surrounded
a round and almost child-like face. Bizet’s figure
was robust. In later years his features were firm,
and his expression was energetic, tempered by the
trust, the frankness, and the goodness that characterized
his nature. He was very short-sighted, and
he wore eyeglasses constantly. His mouth lent
itself as easily to expression of mocking wit as to
kindness. His love for his parents has been already
mentioned; his devotion toward his wife was such
that she told Gounod there was not one minute of the
six years of marriage which she would not gladly live
over. He was a welcome companion, fond of jest
and paradox, frank and loyal. At the house of
Saint-Saëns he played gladly the part of Helen in
Offenbach’s operetta. He was ever firm, even
extravagant in friendship, as when at Baden-Baden
in ‘62 he challenged a man who spoke lightly of
Gounod’s “Queen of Sheba.” When the talk was
concerning musicians whom he loved, Bach, Mozart,
Rossini, Verdi, Gounod, his voice would lose its
peculiar sibilance, and his hot eloquence showed
honesty as well as nimble wit and power of expression.
In all of the recollections of troops of friends,
in his letters to acquaintances and friends there is
not a suggestion of mean action, scheming purpose,
low or narrow thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the age of fourteen Bizet was a master of the
pianoforte; his technique was above reproach; he
was particularly skilful in mixing his colors: an
exquisitely defined melody had its proper and characteristic
background. Halévy and Liszt are of the
many witnesses to his extraordinary talent for reading
from score at sight. Reyer speaks of his remarkable
memory. And yet Bizet never appeared
in public as a pianist; although in certain salons of
Paris his abilities excited lively admiration.</p>

<p class='c007'>So too his gifts as a composer for orchestra were
more than ordinary; but whenever he had an opportunity
to write for the stage, he abandoned any
instrumental work that had interested him.</p>

<p class='c007'>For Bizet obeyed the instincts of the French musician
and looked to the stage for enduring fame.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no need of close examination of “The
Pearl Fishers,” and “The Fair Maid of Perth.”
We know the later works of Bizet, and therefore we
find hints of genius in the early operas. With the
exception of the duet of Nadir and Zurga and of a
few pages saturated with local color, there is little in
“The Pearl Fishers” to herald the arrival of a
master of the stage. There are delightful examples
of instrumentation in “The Fair Maid of Perth”:
the opera as a whole is conventional, and the solo
passages and the ensemble are often reminiscent:
there is continual homage to famous men: Gounod,
Halévy, Verdi, Thomas, <em>et al.</em> Bizet had not yet
found the use of his own voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor would “Djamileh,” the satisfaction of the
longing of Camille du Locle for ideal musical revery,
the sounding of the revolt against the school of
Scribe, carry the name of Bizet to after years. Its
perfume is subtle and penetrating; its colors delight
trained eyes. It is a <em>tour de force</em>. It has the affected
frankness of a pastel in prose. The hearer
must be mastered by the spirit of the Orient to
thoroughly enjoy. The three comedians should be
seen as in an opium dream.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fame of Bizet must rest eventually on two
works: “L’Arlésienne” and “Carmen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I believe “L’Arlésienne” is the more artistic, the
greater work. In “Carmen” is the greater promise
of what Bizet might have done. The music of
“L’Arlésienne,” is inseparably associated with success
or failure of the play itself and the abilities of
play-actors. If the concert-suite is played, it
pleases; but apart from the representation of the
dramatic scenes, the music loses its true significance.
The saxophone solo in the Prelude, with
its marvellous accompaniment, gratifies the ear in the
concert-room; but its haunting and melancholy
beauty is intensified tenfold when it is associated with
the apparition of “The Innocent.” It is impossible
to over-rate the beauty, the passion, the dramatic
fitness of the music that accompanies the various
scenes in the simple and terrible drama of Daudet.
The dialogue between <i><span lang="fr">Mère Renaud</span></i> and <em>Balthazar</em>
when they meet after fifty years is touching; but
the <em>adagietto</em>, that softly tells of humble heroism,
love preserved without shame, the kiss given at last
and without passion, longings and regrets endured
in silence, rises to a height of pathos that is beyond
the reach of words or pantomime. In connection
with the scene and the dialogue the <em>adagietto</em> is
irresistible in its effect; in the concert room, it is
simply a beautiful piece for muted strings. This
play of Daudet is so simple, so devoid of trickery
that its popular and universal success is extremely
doubtful. The average spectator would fain see the
unworthy <cite>Woman of Arles</cite> for whom <em>Fréderi</em> burns
in agony; the shepherd <em>Balthazer</em> seems to him a
good, tiresome old man with a beard; <em>The Innocent</em>,
unless the part is played with rare finesse, becomes
almost ludicrous. Not until there is a return to the
appreciation of simplicity will this music of Bizet be
known as the supreme example of music in the
domain of melodrama.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meilhac and Halévy in the libretto of “Carmen,”
feel constantly the pulse of the audience.</p>

<p class='c007'>The opera is not a sustained masterpiece. The
want of action in the third act is not atoned for by
a display of musical inspiration. With the exception
of the trio of card-players, the music of this
act is far below that of the other three. But, with
the omission of this act, how frank, how intense,
how characteristic, is the music that tells of a tragedy
of universal and eternal interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>For <cite>Carmen</cite> lived years before she was known by
Merimée. She dies many deaths, and many are her
resurrections. When the world was young, they say
her name was Lilith, and the serpent for her sake
hated Adam. She perished that wild night when
the heavens rained fire upon the Cities of the Plain.
Samson knew her when she dwelt in the valley of
Sorek. The mound builders saw her and fell at her
feet. She disquieted the blameless men of Ethiopia.
Years after she was the friend of Theodora.
In the fifteenth century she was noticed in Sabbatic
revels led by the four-horned goat. She was in
Paris at the end of the last century, and she wore
powder and patches at the dinners given by the
Marquis de Sade. In Spain she rolled cigarettes
and wrecked the life of <cite><span lang="es">Don José</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dramatic genius of Bizet is seen fully in his
treatment of this character. She sings no idle
words. Each tone stabs. There are here no agreeable
or sensuous love passages; as Bellaigue remarks,
there is not a touch of voluptuousness in the
opera. The soldier is under the spell of a vain,
coarse, reckless gipsy of maddening personality. He
knows the folly, the madness of his passion; he
sees “as from a tower the end of all.” These characters
are sharply drawn and forcibly painted.
There is free use of the palette knife; there is fine
and ingenious detail. The singers sing because it is
the natural expression of their emotions; they do
not sing to amuse the audience or accommodate the
stage carpenter. The orchestra with wealth of
rhythm and color italicizes the song; prepares the
action; accompanies it; or moralizes. Apart from
the technical skill shown in the instrumentation, the
great ability of Bizet is seen in his combining the
French traditions of the past and the German spirit
of the present without incongruity. Here is a departure
from old models, and yet a confirmation.
The quintet is sung because thereby the feeling of
the scene is best expressed; five people are not introduced
because the quintet is an agreeable combination
of voices. The unmeaning vocal ornaments
found in the earlier operas of Bizet have disappeared.
He uses his own manly, intense speech.
He expresses his own thoughts in his own way.
He does not care whether his work is opéra comique
or grand opera, or melodrama. His sole object
is to tell his story as directly and as forcibly as
possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a world of art that is too often ruled by insincerity,
a lusty, well-trained voice aroused the attention.
Suddenly the voice was hushed. Only with
the silence, came the hearty approval of the great
audience. Bizet met with no popular success during
his lifetime. Now “Carmen” holds the stage;
“L’Arlésienne” excites the admiration of all musicians;
the earlier operas have been revived and
sung in foreign languages. In his own country he
was from the start known vulgarly as “one of the
most ferocious of the French Wagnerian school”:
an absurd charge: for in no one of his operas is
there recognition of the peculiar theories of Wagner.
Bizet followed the traditional formulas: he used
the air, the concerted pieces, the formal divisions
and subdivisions. The orchestra assists the singer;
it does not usurp his place. Without doubt he
learned from Wagner in the matter of orchestral
expression, as Wagner learned from Weber and
Meyerbeer; as one sensible man does from his predecessors.
There was nothing new in Bizet’s use of
the typical motive; it was similarly employed by
Grétry, Auber, Halévy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Melody, expressive harmony, ingenious counterpoint,
an unerring sense of the value of a peculiar
tone of an instrument or the advantage of a combination
of instruments,—these were used by the
Bizet of later years simply to express truth. This
was the purpose of his life; this was the motto of his
existence. No one could be more refined than he
in musical expression; no one could be more seemingly
brutal. The glowing words that he wrote
concerning Verdi in the Revue Nationale show his
one prevailing thought: “Let us then be frank and
true; let us not demand of a great artist qualities
which he lacks, and let us profit from the qualities
which he possesses. When a passionate, violent,
even brutal temperament; when a Verdi presents us
with a strong and living work full of gold and mud,
of gall and blood, let us not go to him and say
coldly, ‘But, my dear Sir, this is wanting in taste, it
is not <em>distingué</em>.’ <em>Distingué!</em> Are Michael-Angelo,
Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Beethoven, Cervantes,
and Rabelais <em>distingués</em>?”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is presumptuous, it is impossible to anticipate
the verdict of Time the Avenger. It is not improbable,
however, that the future historian of the opera
will class Bizet with Wagner and Verdi as the men
of mighty influence over the opera of the last years
of this century. “Carmen” was, perhaps, a promise,
a starting point, rather than a fulfillment. But
if the young and fiery composers of Italy of to-day
turn reverently toward Verdi and Wagner, they also
read lovingly the score of “Carmen.”</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
The eminent composer, Camille
Saint-Saëns, was born in Paris,
October 9, 1835. While yet an
infant he manifested an innate gift
for music. We are informed by
the most reliable of his biographers, his grand-aunt,
that, observing the deep attention with which
the child listened to music, she gave him his first
lessons on the piano when he was scarcely three
years old. It would not be easy to find a record of
earlier precocity. His mother relates, when her
son began to play the first exercise, C, D, E, F, G,
she discovered him playing it with only the right
hand, using the other hand to press the weak little
fingers down, in order to sound each note distinctly.
It was ingenious, almost virtuosity! That a child
like Saint-Saëns should make rapid progress was
inevitable. When his fingers were sufficiently
strong to strike the keys of the pianoforte without
great effort, his grand-aunt, believing that she had
reached the end of her task with him, placed him in
charge of a professional teacher of the pianoforte.
It was not long before this teacher was replaced in
turn, by a master worthy of such a pupil, and wholly
capable of guiding his studies. This master was
Stamaty, and the choice was admirable. In addition
to Stamaty, who was only a teacher of the pianoforte,
M. Maledan, an able instructor in harmony
and theory and a man of decided talent, was engaged
to guide the more serious musical studies of
young Saint-Saëns.</p>

<p class='c007'>The boy was ten years old when his mother resolved
that he should make the acquaintance of
some of the notabilities of the musical world before
making his first appearance in public. To this end
she gave a private soirée at her house, the result of
which was echoed through the press of Paris.
The lad performed, with Stamaty, one of Mozart’s
Sonatas for four hands with surprising ease and in
remarkable sympathy with the composer’s style.
Then, with a quartet accompaniment, he performed
some of the works of the great masters, including
fugues by Bach, a concerto by Hummel, and Beethoven’s
concerto in C minor.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few months later, he made his début before the
public in a concert given in the Pleyel Salon, so much
favored of artists, and where Chopin and Rubinstein,
not to name other great pianist-composers,
also made their first bow before a Parisian audience.
Little Camille, as he was then styled, achieved
a flattering success. The most eminent critics
sang his praises and predicted a great future
for him. Never did they prophesy with more true
foresight than they did on that occasion. <cite><span lang="fr">L’Illustration</span></cite>
published his portrait, and there were some
who went so far as to draw a comparison between
him and the incomparable Mozart!</p>

<p class='c007'>This brilliant début in nowise spoiled the young
pianist; on the contrary, its effect only increased
his zeal for study. He attended the course of lessons
in composition under Halévy at the Conservatoire
as an <i><span lang="fr">élève auditeur</span></i>, literally, a listening pupil,
for one year. He then obtained admission to the
organ class where he won the first prize. Encouraged
by his success he next appeared as a competitor
at the Institut (Prix de Rome), but failed. He
never again crossed the threshold of the Institut de
France until long afterward, when he was received
with honor and glory as a member of the “Section
Musicale.” When he competed for the Prix de
Rome, he was only seventeen years of age, but he
had already attained celebrity as a pianist and an organist,
and had also distinguished himself as the
composer of several important scores. One of these
was an ode to St. Cecilia, for chorus, solo, and grand
orchestra, which was performed by the Société Sainte
Cécile, of which Seghers was the leader. The newspapers
were as severe upon Saint-Saëns as a composer,
as they had been satisfied with his début as a
pianist. “In the absence of inspiration of the first
order, or of brilliant genius,” writes the critic of the
Gazette Musicale, “it could be wished that the composer
showed a little more <i><span lang="fr">fougue</span></i> and dash, were it
only in a few paltry flights which reveal a young artist’s
desire to create for himself an individual style.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With Saint-Saëns inspiration came later, and it
was pure inspiration, without fault, and was not
wanting in originality.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young composer soon avenged himself for
these harsh criticisms, by composing his first symphony,
in E flat, which was also executed by the Société
Sainte Cécile. The great artist of the future
had not then reached his sixteenth year. The work
was well calculated to encourage the highest hopes
for the future of the symphonist, and these hopes
were abundantly realized by his last and admirable
symphony in C minor, a composition which indeed
may be considered a genuine masterpiece. The
first symphony by the lad of sixteen met with a full
measure of applause; it has been published and is
still frequently played with success. It appears in
the catalogue of his complete works as the musical
leaflet No. 2. The second symphony, in F major,
was performed for the first time in 1856 by the Philharmonic
Society of Bordeaux, and also met with a
warm welcome. A third symphony in D does not appear
in the catalogue, which also does not mention
the second symphony, the only symphonies named
being those in E flat, in A minor (Leaflet 56) and
in C minor (Leaflet 78). It would seem, therefore,
either that two of the five symphonies written by
Saint-Saëns have not been published, or that this
<em>complete</em> catalogue, printed by his publishers,
Durand et Schoenewerk, of Paris, is <em>incomplete</em>.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have purposely omitted to mention four concertos
for piano and orchestra, because these productions,
which are of a high order, have brought to
mind an incident which is worthy a special place in
this biography.</p>

<p class='c007'>These four fine works were brilliantly performed on
the same evening in the Salle Pleyel by Mme. Marie
Jaëll, the pianist so famous for her extraordinary,
not to say marvellous, powers of execution. This
was, indeed, a feat on the part of the virtuoso as
well as an interesting exhibition of artistic talent,
and its success was complete. The performances
began at nine o’clock in the evening and ended at
half-past eleven. Throughout this long and difficult
test there was not the slightest momentary defect,
either in the playing of the orchestra or in that
of the experienced and skilful pianist. For the
success of so difficult a task the most subtle artistic
feeling and exceptional muscular force were necessary.
Mme. Jaëll possessed these qualities in
such measure that the soirée devoted to the four
concertos of Saint-Saëns will never fade from the
memory of those who were present. Besides these
concertos we should mention a concerto-fantaisie
for piano and orchestra written in 1891 for Mme.
Roger-Niclos, which she played with great success
at the Colonne concerts. This work has recently
been published.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his work entitled “Virtuoses Contemporains,”
our dear master and friend, Marmontel, has felicitously
described the style of piano playing characteristic
of Saint-Saëns. “Saint-Saëns is as accomplished
a pianist as he is an organist. He attacks the
piece in hand with great energy, and keeps perfect
time. His fiery and brilliant execution is flawless
even in the most rapid passages. His powerful but
admirably modulated playing is full of majesty and
breadth; and the only fault that can be found with
his masterly execution is, perhaps, the excess of
rhythmical precision. Ever master of himself, Saint-Saëns
leaves nothing to chance and does not, perhaps,
always yield sufficiently to the pathetic. On the other
hand, the virtuoso always acquits himself with irreproachable
accuracy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>For many years Saint-Saëns has quitted Paris in
the winter, to seek the warm sunshine under the blue
skies of those favored countries to which the sun remains
ever faithful. In order to travel and pass his
time free from all annoyance, the composer has
adopted the excellent custom of departing from Paris
without any flourish of trumpets, without informing
anyone where he intends to sojourn, and often
without knowing, himself, exactly where he will pitch
his tent. On leaving Paris on the 30th of November,
1889, he charged his worthy friend and colleague,
Guiraud, of the Institut, now no more, alas!
in case the Académie de Musique should authorize
the rehearsals of his “Ascanio,” to begin during
the composer’s absence. It was put in hand, and
M. Guiraud, with score before him, followed the
rehearsals with the utmost care and assiduity.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The preparations for the opera had made great
progress, and everybody expected, at any moment,
the composer’s return. Not only did he refrain from
reappearing in Paris to assist at the last rehearsals and
to give his final hints to the singers and the orchestra,
but he did not even write to anyone. Nobody
knew where he had concealed himself. This extraordinary
and unheard-of act of a composer, who
goes abroad to amuse himself by chasing butterflies
or collecting plants, while at home the theatrical
managers are making preparations for the first performance
of a work of such importance as a grand
five-act opera, excited all Paris. It even disturbed
the Government, which caused inquiry to be made
for the musician by its diplomatic agents throughout
the world. The search was a vain one. It was
generally thought that Saint-Saëns had died in some
part of Ceylon, where certain French travellers believed
they had seen him as he was making his way
to Japan. The first performance of “Ascanio” was
given at a moment when it was in doubt whether
Saint-Saëns was dead or alive. Happily, he was still
of this world and in very good health; but careless
of his glory, was basking in the sunshine of the
Canary Islands, busily engaged in finishing a volume
of verse which appeared in Paris last year; for Saint-Saëns
is a poet as well as a musician. It was a relief
to the public when an announcement was at last
made by Louis Gallet, the composer’s fellow-worker
and friend, that the fugitive, at the very moment
when “Ascanio” was under active rehearsal at the
Opéra, was peacefully and contentedly breathing the
warm and balmy air of Palma. As soon as the
newspapers betrayed his sojourn in this verdant and
flowery retreat, the authorities of the city and the
principal inhabitants proposed to confer honors upon
the master. But the composer had not gone all
the way to Teneriffe for this purpose, and thanking
the authorities for the homage they wished to pay
him, immediately disappeared again!</p>

<p class='c007'>Saint-Saëns is a husband and a father, but his
married life has unfortunately not been a very happy
one. His two children both died at an early age.
One of them fell from the balcony of his father’s
house, and was killed, while the other suddenly died
a short time afterward. Thus it sometimes happens
that a man may have, like Saint-Saëns, everything
that goes to make up the sum of human happiness—talent,
success, honor and fortune,—and yet
yearn in vain for that complete felicity which is denied
him. Concealed like the statue of Isis, whose
veil no mortal has ever been permitted to draw
aside, is the condition of unalloyed happiness on
this earthly sphere. We know that it exists; we
seek it; ofttimes we think it within our grasp,
and yet it eludes us!</p>

<p class='c007'>We cannot more fitly terminate this sketch of
the great personality of Saint-Saëns than by adding
that he is one of the most masterly readers of piano
and organ music who has ever lived, and an improviser
of the first rank.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a child pianist and composer, Camille Saint-Saëns
was what is called an infant prodigy. The
child has come to man’s estate and is, at the present
moment, one of the most learned and able
artists in every branch of his art, that can be found
in the ranks of modern musicians. Since the death
of Beethoven, Schumann and Mendelssohn, he
wields in Europe the sceptre of symphony; he is
renowned as a composer for the church and the
theatre, and as an organist; and the mastery he has
shown in the concerto, the oratorio and chamber
music, of which he has produced a large number of
works, is of world-wide fame.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of his purely instrumental music we may mention,
in chronological order: “Tarentelle,” for flute
and clarinet with orchestra; “Orient et Occident,”
a military march; Ballade for piano, organ
and violin; Introduction and Rondo Capricioso,
for violin and piano; “Le Rouet d’Omphale,” a
symphonic poem; Concerto for violoncello in A
minor; Sonato for piano and violoncello; Heroic
March for full orchestra; Ballade for horn or violoncello
and piano, in F; Ballade for flute or violin and
piano; Lullaby for piano and violin, in B flat;
“Phaéton,” a symphonic poem; “Danse Macabre,”
for Orchestra, arranged for piano, for one or two
performers, and for one or two pianos; also for
piano duet, with violin or violoncello; for military
band, etc; Quartet for piano, violin, alto and violoncello;
Allegro appassionata, for violoncello and
piano; Ballade for violin and piano, in C; Suite for
orchestra; prelude, saraband, gavotte, ballade and
finale; “La Jeunesse d’Hercule,” symphonic poem;
Ballade for violoncello and piano in D; Concerto
for violin in C major; “Suite Algérienne,” for
orchestra; Concerto for violin, in B minor; Concert
piece for violin and piano; “Une Nuit à Lisbonne,”
barcarolle for orchestra; “La Jota Aragonaise,”
for orchestra; Septet for trumpet, two violins,
alto, violoncello, contra-bass and piano; Hymn to
Victor Hugo, for orchestra; Sonata for piano and
violin in D minor; “Wedding-Cake,” Caprice
Valse for piano and stringed instruments; Caprice
on Danish and Russian airs, for flute, oboe, clarinet
and piano; “Havanaise” for violin and piano;
“La Fiancée du Timbalier,” for orchestra; etc., etc.</p>

<p>Fac-simile autograph musical manuscript contributed by the composer for use in this work</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We bear in mind several scores by Saint-Saëns
which do not appear in the general catalogue of his
works. First of all, there is a very fine composition
for a military band, which the illustrious musician
was good enough to write at my request, in 1868, for
the celebration of Hoche’s centenary at Versailles.
A short time ago I asked Saint-Saëns why he had
not published this beautiful work, written as a tribute
to the memory of the great French general,
and which is so full of stirring patriotic sentiment.
The composer replied that he did not know what
had become of this music since the day on which
it was solemnly performed before the statue of
Hoche at Versailles. The full score and the orchestral
parts have remained undiscovered up to
the present time. I may also mention, as among
the compositions of Saint-Saëns, which are not
included in the catalogue of his works, an extremely
original, bright and thoroughly artistic work written
for several instruments and called “Le Carnaval
des Animaux.” Only one of the animals in this
merry Carnival has been honored by publication,
viz.: “The Swan,” whose song is interpreted in this
zoölogical symphony by the violoncello.</p>

<p class='c007'>The works by Saint-Saëns for piano solo, duet,
and for two pianos are very numerous. All of them
are vigorously characteristic of the decided and
learned style of the master, and are also marked by
a certain individuality peculiar to this famous
pianist-composer.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is well known that the composer is one of the
most renowned organists in Europe. As might be
expected, he has written specially for this instrument,
which, figuratively speaking, is the embodiment
of all other instruments. We will only mention the
Rhapsodies on the Breton canticles; also the
“Bénédiction Nuptiale” and “Elévation et Communion,”
which are noble works for the King of
Instruments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Saint-Saëns succeeded Lefébvre Wely as organist
at the Madeleine. Among his church compositions
he has composed a Grand Mass for four voices,
soli and orchestra; “Tantum Ergo,” a Chorus; a
“Christmas Oratorio” for chorus, soli and orchestra;
Psalm XVIII.—“Cœli enarrant” for soli, chorus
and orchestra; “Le Déluge,” biblical poem for
soli, chorus and orchestra; and a Requiem which,
with the oratorio “Le Déluge,” we include among
his best works. There is also a collection of
twenty separate motets for the Holy Communion,
motets to the Virgin, and other miscellaneous motets.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may further mention among the characteristic
compositions which are not in the religious or the
dramatic style:—Scene from Corneille’s “Les
Horaces,” for soprano, baritone and orchestra; six
Persian melodies, vocal and instrumental (piano);
“Les Soldats de Gédéon,” double chorus without
accompaniment; “Chanson du Grand-papa,” chorus
for female voices; “Chanson d’un Ancêtre,” chorus
for male voices with baritone solo; “La Lyre et la
Harpe,” soli, chorus and orchestra; two choruses
with piano accompaniment: “Calme des Nuits” and
“Les Fleurs et les Arbres”; two choruses for male
voices without accompaniment: “Les Marins de
Kermor” and “Les Titans”; “Les Guerriers,”
chorus for male voices; several other choruses,
besides some fifty duets and melodies with piano
accompaniment. We abridge the list in order to
mention the composer’s dramatic works: “Le
Timbre d’Argent”; “La Princesse Jaune,” comic
opera in one act; “Proserpine,” lyric drama in
four acts; “Etienne Marcel,” opera in four acts;
“Samson et Dalila,” biblical opera in three acts;
“Henry VIII.,” opera in four acts; and lastly,
“Ascanio,” opera in five acts.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been said with truth that Saint-Saëns
is of all composers the one who differs most from
himself, in his dramatic works. We mean by this
that he has emancipated himself from the hard and
fast lines of any particular school; that he has no
system and is guided wholly by his own inspiration,
tempered and strengthened by great musical
learning. He could, if he so desired, write according
to the theories or in the manner of this or of
that composer, but he prefers to write as his genius
follows its own individual vein, agreeing, no doubt,
with his famous colleague and friend, Charles
Gounod, that if there are many systems of composition,
there are, after all, only two kinds of music:
that which is good and that which is bad. His
admiration for all the great masters is profound,
but he strives to imitate none, this has caused certain
critics to subject him to the reproach of eclecticism.
He has expressed himself on this point
with frank sincerity (for Saint-Saëns is a man
as well as a musician) in a highly interesting volume
entitled “Harmonie et Mélodie.” After declaring
that he had never belonged to any religion in
music, he adds: “I claim to preserve my liberty,
to like what pleases me and to reject the rest; to
believe good that which is good, discordant
that which is discordant, absurd that which is
absurd. This is precisely what the more ardent
disciples of Wagner refuse to concede. They grasp
you by the throat, and insist that you must admire
everything Wagnerian, no heed what it may be.
With them there is something beyond love of art:
the spirit of sectarianism. I am afraid of sectarians,
and so keep myself prudently aloof from them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was of these Wagnerian critics, who carry their
love for the composer of “music-dramas” to the
point of fanatic intolerance, even of ferocity, that
Saint-Saëns was thinking when he wrote these lines,
as well as others that we shall quote presently; and
these same critics accused our composer of the
crime of refusing to enlist under the banner of the
master of Bayreuth. They sought to crush Saint-Saëns
in their criticisms of his last great opera,
“Ascanio,” by saying, not only had he here perpetrated
the heresy of adhering to that form of
opera that prevailed before Wagner propounded his
theories of the “lyric drama,” but that he had also
forgotten himself so far as to write airs in the
Italian style! These amiable censors showed themselves
more royalist than the king himself, for as a
matter of fact Wagner by no means despised
Italian airs; on the contrary, he liked them very
much if we may believe what he has said. The following
words of the composer of “Lohengrin” are
worth remembering: “After listening to an opera
by Bellini, that has delighted us, we discover on
reflection, that its charm is owing to the clear
melody, to the simple, lofty and beautiful song of
the Italian composer. To treasure in the memory
these delightful melodies is certainly no grave sin.
Nor is it a heavier one to pray to heaven, before
retiring to rest, that it may inspire German composers
with the secret of these melodies and a like
manner of using them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The truth is that in music, as in all other arts,
we do what we can rather than what we should
most like to do, and he is wisest who is guided
by his own genius. The genius of Camille Saint-Saëns
is so rich in resources that he can safely trust
himself and let the spirit work within him as it
wills. There are composers who, forgetting that
beauty is inseparable from high art, strive after
eminence by seeking originality at any cost, and who
do not disdain to make that art, harmonious before
and beyond all other arts, the art of torturing our
ears with music that is <em>per se</em> inharmonious. Is not
Saint-Saëns right when, in speaking of these psychological
and hysterical composers, he says with
peculiar felicity: “It is certain that we cannot work
too hard to instil in the public a taste for pleasures
of an elevated order; but to offer it what is ingeniously
described as ‘painful pleasure,’ to offer a
feast consisting of ‘exquisite suffering’ and ‘poetic
perversion,’ merely ends in mortification. When
we wish to mortify our souls we do not go to the
theatre but to a convent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We may be asked for the opinion of the composer
of “Faust,” “Roméo et Juliette” and
“Mireille,” concerning the composer of “Samson
et Dalila,” “Henry VIII.” and “Ascanio.” I am
in a position to answer the question. Gounod has
spoken of Saint-Saëns in connection with his last
opera as follows: “That in the lyric drama, music
should coalesce with the drama and blend in one harmonious
whole is an excellent theory, but only on
condition that in this indissoluble union, music shall
still be true and beautiful music; otherwise the
union is no more than a cruel bondage for one of
the arts so joined, and that art is Music. Throughout
the works of Saint-Saëns we are in communion
with an artist who never for an instant forgets or
sacrifices his art; everywhere and always is the
great musician present, and everywhere, too, the
drama appears before him as a <em>law</em>, not as a <em>yoke</em>.
Passions, characters, situations, are felt by him
with the same certainty of discernment, whether in
song, declamation, recitative, or in the dramatic
part which must be played by his orchestra; and all
this in an idiom and a form which are musically
irreproachable, insomuch that he has created true
and lasting ‘morceaux de musique’ even where
the librettist did not provide the frame-work
expected of him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Were we not limited as to space, it would be
a pleasing task to present here a technical and
æsthetic analysis of the operas of the French master
concerning whom we write thus briefly; but this
would carry us too far. Suffice it, from what we
have already written, for the reader to form a satisfactory
judgment on the instrumental and vocal
works of Saint-Saëns. In the “Timbre d’Argent,”
which has something in common with the fable of
“Faust,” we are in the midst of a musical and
choreographic fantasy. This score is very attractive
and well emphasizes a very pretty performance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“La Princesse Jaune” transports us into the
East, where reality seems as a dream. It is a
drawing-room comedy, the scene of which is laid in
a Japanese village, where Dutch tulips grow as rank
as does the grass in the fields; where the sky is
blue, where everything is full of color and appears
smiling, joyous and lovable.</p>

<p class='c007'>In “Etienne Marcel,” the illustrious Prévôt des
Marchands, we have historical drama, in the civil
war waged for the triumph of communal liberties.
The rioters force a violent entrance into the Palais
de la Cité, and the voices of scoffers are heard
alternating with the cries of raving fanatics. It is
terrible, and quite characteristic of the Parisian
mind in the troublous times when the streets became
one great battle-field. Love, of course, finds
its place in “Etienne Marcel,” a love gentle and
searching. Some of the contrasts are most happy,
the choruses are superb, the volume of sound is
sublime.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Samson et Dalila,” as is sufficiently indicated
by the title, is a biblical opera, almost an oratorio,
reminding us of the “Joseph” of Méhul. I was
overflowing with enthusiasm on coming out from
the representation of “Samson et Dalila.” This
score and the symphony in C minor are, I believe,
the two finest jewels in the crown of this musical
king. They are works full of the highest inspiration,
of a most sublime cast, wonderfully elaborate
in style, and masterpieces in the fullest sense of
the word.</p>

<p class='c007'>The gloomy subject of “Henry VIII.” opened
up new fields to Saint-Saëns, and afforded him a
local color that influenced his music. The moment
the score opens, we feel that we know exactly where
we are and whither we are going. The principal
personages in the drama have been each and all
instantaneously portrayed and their diverse characters
are accurately represented. The king of England,
the Pope’s nightmare and the terror of his
queenly wives and victims, is, from a musical point
of view, especially well portrayed in his wild orgies
and brutal amours. Anne Boleyn fails to hide the
pride that lies behind her love, although its expression
is not less charming on that account. Catherine
of Arragon, the noble and unfortunate forsaken
one, is superb in her insulted majesty, her pathetic
and sweet melancholy. The choruses are treated
in a masterly manner, and there is one important
“morceau d’ensemble” which is a signal triumph of
expressive and dramatic counterpoint. The airs in
the ballet impress us as being thoroughly English. As
to the orchestra, the importance of which cannot be
over-estimated, it plays in a measured and finished
style and produces the effect of a powerful organ.
Here we have local color again, cleverly used.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ascanio” is the last dramatic work of Saint-Saëns.
The fanatical partisans of the Wagnerian
theories, as we have already observed, were not
sparing of bitter criticism. Saint-Saëns must have
found ample consolation for this in the continuous
applause showered upon him by the public which
always cordially welcomes whatever affords it pleasure.
“Ascanio” is indeed equal in all respect to
“Henry VIII.,” and worthy the composer, which is
saying not a little of a man who has given such
treasures to all lovers of music.</p>

Jules Emile Frédéric
Massenet was born on the 12th
of May, 1842, at Montaud, in the
department of the Loire, and was
the eleventh child of his parents.
His musical talent developed at an early age.
When only eleven years old he was sufficiently acquainted
with the theoretical elements of the art to
take his place in François Bazin’s harmony class in
the Conservatoire. It is by no means uncommon
for a professor to mistake the capacity of his pupils.
Unfortunately Bazin failed to foresee the splendid
future reserved for his young pupil Massenet: on
the contrary, he believed him to be destitute of all
musical talent and requested that he might be dismissed
from his class. The poor little musician
felt so deeply humiliated by this insult that he was
almost inclined to renounce music forever. It was
five years before he reappeared at the Conservatoire,
but luckily, at the end of that long term, he
returned to study under the learned Henri Reber
in the harmony class.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day, shortly after Massenet joined this class,
Reber addressed him thus in presence of his
fellow-pupils: “Monsieur, I urge you, for your own
welfare, to quit my class and go into a higher one,
a class where fugue and composition are taught.
You understand as much of harmony, so called, as
I can teach you, and you will waste your time if
you remain with me. Follow my advice, for if I
am a true prophet, you will make your mark.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus it was that, dismissed from Bazin’s harmony
class as a dunce, Massenet was advised to leave
Reber’s class because he learned too rapidly. The
youngster followed the advice given by the composer
of “Le Père Gaillard” and “La Nuit de Noël,”
and studied fugue and composition with Ambroise
Thomas, the composer of “Mignon” and “Hamlet,”
who had been appointed director of the school
after the death of Auber.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the composition class young Massenet so distinguished
himself by his ardor and application to
study, that he won, and ever after retained,
the friendship of Ambroise Thomas. At each lesson
he submitted to his master, in addition to
fugues and exercises in counterpoint, instrumental
and vocal works of various kinds, each bearing
witness to his lively imagination and to his instinct to
produce something new. Of course all these efforts
of the future composer of “Manon” were not irreproachable,
and sometimes his comrades rallied
him on what they called his fits of musical intoxication.
“Let him sow his wild oats,” said Ambroise
Thomas, “and you will find that when he has
sobered down and become more reflective he will
achieve something. He is a genius.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The time was close at hand when Massenet was
to fulfil this flattering prophecy. In the very same
year, 1863, he obtained the first prize in counterpoint
and fugue at the Conservatoire and the
Grand Prize for musical composition (Grand Prix
de Rome) at the Institut de France. He was
then, we believe, already married, although physically
he did not look more than fifteen years of
age.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he had an annual allowance accorded him by
the State, he set out for the Eternal City and made
a tour in Italy, proceeding thence to Germany to
seek inspiration from the masters of symphony.
The winner of the Grand Prix de Rome is expected
during his sojourn abroad, to send at least one work
to the Institute as a proof that he has turned his
time to good account and has made due progress.
Whether or not young Massenet left his light-heartedness
behind him when he crossed the French
frontier we cannot say; but the composition he
sent from Rome was a Requiem. Massenet wrote
a large work for solo voices, chorus and orchestra,
entitled “Pompéia,” which in form as well as in
instrumentation showed the influence of Berlioz.
This indicated an inquiring and meditative mind in
the young composer, who was thus feeling his way
through the boldest and most modern school of
music.</p>

<p class='c007'>Massenet sent a second envoy from Rome, which
was his first orchestral suite. With this suite is
associated an event of great importance in the
musical career of the composer. Massenet tells
the story himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The composer had just returned to France, after
passing in Italy and Germany the regulation period
accorded the laureates of the Institute. While
walking in the street, he met Pasdeloup, the founder
and director of the celebrated “Popular Concerts.”
Pasdeloup was one of the best men in the world,
but he had the habit of treating young composers
in a brusque and patronizing manner. He had
only seen Massenet once, and that was during the
performance of the cantata for which he was
awarded the Grand Prize. As has already been
stated, Massenet always looked much younger than
he really was, and from his twentieth to his twenty-fourth
year he had the face and air of a boy of
sixteen. Pasdeloup accosted him with a frown, as
though he had something disagreeable to tell him,
and speaking in an offensively familiar and condescending
manner, said:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, so you have returned to France. What have
you been doing during your absence?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been writing music, M. Pasdeloup.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is all very well; but it is not sufficient to
write music; you must write good music. Is your
music really good?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir, it is not for me to pass judgment upon it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have written, I believe, an orchestral
suite?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, but everybody writes orchestral suites.
Is yours a good one? Are you satisfied with it
yourself?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Monsieur Pasdeloup, I feel obliged to
admit that it pleases me when I play it on the piano,
but I have not yet heard it performed by an orchestra.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course it pleases you. But how much music
is there that pleases its composer, and yet is not
worth a button. Can I see your manuscript?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do me too much honor, Monsieur Pasdeloup.
I will send my score to you this very
evening.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good. I will tell you what I think of it and
whether it pleases me as much as it pleases you.
Let me say that I think very little of the music of
young men who win the Prix de Rome. They only
know how to imitate the faults of the masters
they study. However, we shall see.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Pasdeloup quitted Massenet with an air of
utter dissatisfaction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young composer hastened home and told his
family of the interview and of the faint hope he
cherished that his suite might possibly be performed
at the famous Popular Concerts. He then rolled
up his score, took it to Pasdeloup’s residence, and
left it with the concierge. Ten days later
Massenet received, by post, a gift which filled him
with equal joy and surprise. It was a ticket admitting
him to a rehearsal. He was invited to the
Cirque d’Hiver, where the Popular Concerts were
given, to hear a rehearsal of his orchestral suite.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next day, full of excitement, he set out for the
rehearsal. On arriving at the door, however, he had
not sufficient courage to enter, so overcome was he
by his emotions. “Perhaps,” thought he, “the
orchestral effect may not be what I intended,” and
he felt that he had not strength to brave the severe
criticisms of Pasdeloup and the jeers of the members
of the orchestra.</p>

<p class='c007'>Massenet returned home without having dared to
listen to the rehearsal of his work and wholly discontented
with himself. He called himself a coward
and a pretender, and as he passed along the boulevard,
his eye mechanically seeking the announcement
of the performances at the theatres and concerts,
he was suddenly astounded to see his own
name on the programme of the Pasdeloup Concert
to be given on the following Sunday. They were
really going to play his suite! He ran rather than
walked home to announce the glorious news.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They play—my suite—Sunday—Popular Concert!—Oh!
how my heart beats!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the great composer, as the memory of the
beginning of his musical career came back to him,
bowed his head on my breast and burst into tears.
I wept with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah!” said he, “I was happier then than I am
to-day. Anticipation is better than the reality.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The opera “Manon” has a curious history which
Massenet related to me one day. Everybody
knows in what singular circumstances the author of
“Manon Lescaut” (Abbé Prévost) took refuge at
The Hague. It was in that city that he wrote his
“Mémoires d’un Homme de Qualité” to which
“Manon Lescaut” seems to belong as a species of
postscript or sequel. In a like manner, and in that
Dutch town, Massenet, owing to certain circumstances,
chanced to write the score of “Manon” the
substance of which is taken from the Abbé Prévost’s
romance. Wishing to remain apart from the rest of
the world, in order to be quite undisturbed, he took
lodgings as a boarder under an assumed name at a
house in The Hague. To prevent all suspicion as to
identity, he did not send for a piano, for, unlike
some composers, Massenet does not need a piano
to enable him to compose. He thinks out his
music, which he hears inwardly, already arranged
for the orchestra. Absorbed in his work, the composer
labored unceasingly. He never went forth
to take necessary exercise until after nightfall, that
he might run no risk of being recognized. After
his walk, which lasted about an hour, he returned
home with coat collar turned up to conceal his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was accustomed to write at a large table littered
with music-paper, each sheet bearing thirty
staves. When not actually engaged in composing he
amused himself by reading the Abbé Prévost’s romance,
written by the French author in that same
foreign town, possibly even in that same house,
more than a century before. And Massenet’s artistic
imagination saw in this fact a happy prognostic.
“Why,” thought he, “should not my score of
‘Manon’ be as successful as was Prévost’s immortal
novel? Grant, O, Sovereign God of Inspiration,
that I may cause the sweet and loving Manon to
sing, after a lapse of a hundred years, under the
same sky, far away from Paris, and in the same
happy strain as that in which the most worldly of
abbés made her speak!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The existence of the mysterious foreigner who
was always writing music but who never played any
instrument, greatly exercised Massenet’s landlord.
The inmates of the house were not less mystified
than was he. The gossips agreed that this French
musician was a choir-master—and a very original
one. At last the composer was recognized, and
the next day the newspapers informed the public
that Massenet had been for some time at The
Hague. People flocked to see him, and his apartments
were speedily crowded with friends or with
persons who came from mere curiosity. Happily,
however, the score of “Manon” was completed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Massenet is one of the most estimable of men,
kind and sympathetic to a fault, and possessed of
great delicacy and consideration for others. He
would enjoy the friendship of all men, were he less
talented and consequently less liable to inspire
jealousy. Of medium stature, spare but well made
and of striking appearance, he has always looked
younger than he really was, a happy privilege
among the many others enjoyed by this favored
son of genius, who is an honor and glory of the
present generation of French composers. He is
now a member of the Institute of France, a professor
of composition at the National Conservatory
of Paris and an Officer of the Legion of Honor.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we close this biographical sketch, the distinguished
composer has just given the first performance
of his latest opera, “Werther,” at the Grand
Theatre of Vienna, where it met with brilliant success.
Massenet has been kind enough to bestow
on us a page of the work to place in this biography,
with a specimen of his handwriting, and we tender
him our warmest thanks. By the time these lines
meet the eye of the reader, “Werther” will have been
put upon the stage at the Opéra Comique, in Paris.</p>

<p class='c007'>Massenet’s debut in theatrical work dates from
the third of April, 1866, when “La Grand’tante,” a
pretty little piece full of melody and freshness, was
represented at the Opéra Comique. It was he who,
on the Emperor’s fête, August 12 of the following
year, wrote the official cantata performed at the
Opéra.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this first attempt in theatrical music, and
his cantata, Massenet produced various concert
works, among others, “Poèmes et Souvenirs” and
“Poèmes d’Avril,” the words of which are by Armand
Sylvestre; also a <em>bouffe</em> scene entitled “L’Improvisateur.”
His second Suite d’Orchestre,—a Suite Hongroise,
was played at the Concerts Populaires. For
the Société Classique Armingaud he composed
“Introductions et Variations,” a quartet for stringed
and wind instruments. In 1872 he produced his
second dramatic work, “Don César de Bazan,” at the
Opéra Comique; but the public did not give it a
very cordial reception. It had been written under
unfavorable conditions, improvised, as it were, in
three weeks. The managers of the theatre proposed
terms to the young composer which he was obliged
to accept or decline without amendment. Massenet
took his revenge for this treatment, however,
in the very same year, with the delightful scenic
music for the drama, “Les Errynies,” by the Comte
de Lisle, which was represented at the Odéon.
The next year, 1873, the composer produced one
of his most exquisite scores, which shows his warm
poetic talent in the most characteristic manner.
This was “Marie Madeleine,” a sacred drama in
three acts, which has had a world-wide success. So
successful was it indeed that Massenet was encouraged
to write “Eve,” a mystery in three acts.
This latter, so intimately related in character to
“Marie Madeleine,” has been given at the concerts of
sacred harmony established by Lamoureux. In
this, too, the composer’s personality is emphasized
by exquisitely delicate and poetic touches. The
same may be said of “La Vierge,” a sacred legend in
four parts, written for the Opéra concerts and
played for the first time in 1880. The “Sleep of the
Virgin” in this legend is one of those inspirations
which prove beyond all doubt the measure of a composer’s
genius.</p>

<p class='c007'>A year before the production of “La Vierge,”
Massenet had given the French National Academy
of Music his first great opera, “Le Roi de Lahore,”
in five acts, the success of which was not at first evident.
The public considered this beautiful music
slightly cold, and instrumental rather than vocal.
They said the composer had shown himself wanting
in melody, and that he had sacrificed too much
to his love for scientific combinations, although
wild applause greeted a certain number of happily-conceived
songs, among others the aria so splendidly
rendered by Lassalle and which has always
been honored with an encore.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is only when great works are reproduced after
a certain interval of time that we can determine
whether they are really worthy a place in the
musical repertory. The reproduction at the Opéra
of the “Roi de Lahore” was a great success, and it
has always been enthusiastically received in the
principal theatres of Europe and America.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Théâtre de la Monnaie, at Brussels, enjoyed
the privilege of giving, in 1881, the first performance
of Massenet’s second grand opera, “Hérodiade” in
three acts and five tableaux. This time success
was beyond all doubt, and from the first representation
onward, the piece was received with enthusiasm.
Whatever M. Massenet may hereafter give
to the world, “Hérodiade” will undoubtedly remain
one of the finest works that have originated in
the fertile brain of this distinguished musician.
Throughout the work the divine afflatus is maintained,
and melody fills the auditorium. The opera
is full of passion and sentiment, at once human
and religious, just as in “Marie Madeleine.” It
might be said that “Hérodiade” is the same sacred
drama brought upon the stage, with this difference,
that Madeleine becomes Salome, and Christ is transformed
into John.</p>

<p class='c007'>After “Hérodiade,” in Brussels, we had, in 1884,
“Manon” at the Opéra Comique in Paris. Were I
asked to make a definite choice between “Hérodiade”
and “Manon” I should hesitate; but I should
choose “Manon.” From the first to the last note
the work is delightful. It is not less beautiful
when softly sung at home to the accompaniment
of the piano, than in the theatre, where our delight
never for an instant moderates.</p>

<p class='c007'>Following “Manon” in 1885, Massenet’s “Le
Cid” in four acts, was performed at the Grand Opéra
in Paris, and although reproduced several times, this
work still maintains its place in the repertory.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1889, the indefatigable composer returned to
the Opéra Comique with “Esclarmonde,” which
drew crowds to this theatre during several months.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the chronological order of the musician’s
dramatic works, “Esclarmonde” is followed by “Le
Mage,” a grand opera in four acts and six tableaux,
the poem by M. Richepin, performed at the National
Academy of Music in Paris. I have witnessed
several renderings of this work, and have read the
piano score. The more I have studied the opera
the more am I impressed by its wonderful beauty.
The individuality of the work, its passion and grace
and delicacy, its originality as to form and harmony,
are so numerous that it is unnecessary to criticise
it more particularly.</p>

<p class='c007'>All lovers of music know the extent of Massenet’s
skill as a master of harmony. He is a master in
the full meaning of the expression. It would be impossible
for a musician to carry to a higher degree
than he has done the complex art of orchestration
or of counterpoint, so much honored of late years,
though so often abused; or to have more happy
facility as a harmonist. Were I to presume to
criticise anything in the author of “Le Mage,” I
should limit myself to mentioning his too clearly
apparent striving after <em>effect</em> by means of fresh
combinations of instruments. Massenet has too
great a wealth of truly musical ideas for him to
labor so hard for <em>material</em> effects. The true effects
in music are produced by the thought, by the idea,
apart from the application of the thought or idea
to any special instrument. There is scarce any
charm of emotion produced by music save through
the musician’s imagination, that is, by the invention
which results from the inward and profound
emotion felt by the composer. Were it only necessary
to be learned in any given art, only necessary
to possess the power of cleverly combining notes
and the tones of musical instruments, so as to produce
fine musical works, every artist now living
would write masterpieces; for, in truth, the study
of technique has never been carried so far as it has
been during the past twenty years. Technique is
undoubtedly indispensable, but of itself it serves no
purpose and is of no value, unless it be used as the
exponent of the melodic conception which is the
very soul of music.</p>

<p class='c007'>M. Massenet has published seven suites for
orchestra, which may be found in the repertory of
every great musical society. To him we owe various
scenes for chorus and orchestra: “Narcisse,” and
“Biblis”; a symphonic poem entitled “Visions,”
and a large number of fugitive melodies with pianoforte
accompaniment. He has also completed the
score of a ballet, “Le Carillon,” as yet unpublished.</p>

Gounod, the greatest living musician
of France is descended from
a family of artists. His grandfather,
a very distinguished enchaser,
bore the title of “sword
cutler to the king,” and as such occupied an
apartment in the Louvre buildings, a favor which
was granted to only artists of renown. His son,
Jean François Gounod, who was born about 1760,
was a painter of considerable talent. He was a
pupil of Lépicié, and he and Carle Vernet, who
occupied the same studio, competed at the Académie
des Beaux-Arts for the “Prix de Rome.”
Carle Vernet obtained the first prize at this
concours in 1782, and Jean François Gounod
carried off the second in 1783. The latter, however,
devoted himself especially to engraving, in
order that he might always live with his father who
was getting old and needed all his care and attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>J. F. Gounod was serious, melancholy and quite
original in character, as was shown by his conduct
on the death of his father, who lived to be over
ninety years of age. This loss was a great grief
to him, and in the hope of diverting his mind and
driving off melancholy, he undertook a tramp to
Versailles. He had very little money in his pocket.
However, being fatigued by his journey he entered
a public house and went to bed. He remained
several days at Versailles, but, far from being
relieved of his sad thoughts, he was so overwhelmed
by them that he dreaded to return to his rooms in
the Louvre, where he had witnessed his father
breathe his last. He wrote to a friend to say that
he should not return to Paris, but intended to start
immediately for Italy; he begged him to go to his
room, take from his secretary all the money he
might find there, and bring it to him at Versailles,
receiving at the same time his adieux. Once in
possession of his money, Gounod, who disliked
encumbrance of any sort, furnished himself with a
light carpet bag, and with this baggage set off on a
journey which was at that time very long and very
difficult. He travelled all over Italy, remaining
there four or five years; then he returned to Paris,
and to his rooms where nothing had been disturbed,
and resumed work as if he had left it only the evening
before.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of J. F. Gounod’s friends has written the
following lines concerning him: “M. Gounod has
made a reputation in engraving. He has produced
little and his income could scarcely have been
enough to suffice him. Nevertheless, he liked to
work and engraving offered him the quiet and
deliberation which suited his disposition. In
general he spoke but little. When he was obliged
to quit the Louvre, he was quite helpless in regard
to the great confusion which always characterized
his apartment; it was one mass of books, pasteboard,
drawings and articles of all sorts scattered
about, including a dismembered skeleton, whose
bones were all pretty effectually separated from
each other. Fortunately one of his cousins undertook
to transfer for him everything that was
transferable, otherwise Gounod would have abandoned
all. He concluded to marry, for it was
absolutely necessary that somebody should aid him
in finding himself again. He was, nevertheless, a
good and excellent man. His wife was charming,
a very good musician, and it was she who educated
her son. He was getting along in years when he
married, and at his death this son was still very
young.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Very young indeed, for the future author of
“Faust,” “Roméo et Juliette” and “Mireille,”
Charles Gounod, was scarcely five years old when he
lost his father, whom he had not learned to know.
Like Hérold, like Adam, like Halévy, Charles
Gounod was born at Paris, where he first saw the
light June 17, 1818. His mother, a woman of fine
character and high intelligence, neglected nothing
that could contribute to his literary and artistic
education. She was his first music teacher. He
began very young to feel an intense love for this
art, which he was to make illustrious. A pupil of
the Saint Louis lyceum, he was already an excellent
pianist while still pursuing his classical studies at
this establishment, and before completing these
studies he took up a course of harmony with the
famous theoretician, Reicha. He took the degree of
bachelor when he was little more than sixteen years
old, and was admitted to the Conservatoire in the
class of counterpoint and fugue directed by Halévy,
and soon after in the composition class of
Lesueur, one of the greatest masters that ever
glorified the French school. In the following year
Gounod took part in the concours of the Institute
for the “Prix de Rome,” and carried off without
opposition a second grand prize. He was thus
exempted from the military service, since the rules
of the “Concours de Rome” established at that time
this exemption for any pupil having obtained a
prize before the age of twenty. This was in 1837,
and Gounod was only nineteen.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the close of this same year Lesueur died, and
Gounod passed under the instruction of Paër, with
whom he finished his studies. In 1838 he presented
himself again at the Institute, this time
without success, but in 1839 he carried off a brilliant
first prize with a cantata entitled “Fernand,”
the words of which were written by the marquis de
Pastoret. This first prize was almost unanimously
awarded to him, twenty-five votes out of twenty-seven
being in his favor. He left at once for Rome
and there devoted himself almost exclusively for
three or four years, to the study and composition
of religious music, being especially charmed and
influenced by the works of the great Palestrina.
In 1841 he had performed in the Saint-Louis-des
Français church, on the occasion of the fête of king
Louis-Philippe, a grand orchestra mass, with contralto
and tenor solos. Towards the end of the
following year he made a trip through Germany,
pausing for a time in Vienna, where he gave in the
Saint Charles church a Requiem mass which produced
upon its hearers a most profound impression.
Some idea of the effect produced may be had from
an account addressed to one of the Paris papers of
the day, and which seemed invested with a spirit
of prophecy: “On All Soul’s Day” said this
writer, “there was performed at the Saint Charles
church a Requiem, a quite recent work by M.
Charles Gounod. One recognizes in this composition
not only a very marked musical talent which
has already obtained by its assiduity and experience
a high degree of independence, but one sees in it
also a great and wholly individual comprehension,
which breaks away from the beaten tracks in order
to create new forms. In the melodic phrases there
are things which deeply touch and impress the
hearer, things which disclose a grandeur of conception
become very rare in our day, and which
engrave themselves ineffaceably upon the soul,
things which would do honor to any musician, and
which seem to point to a great future. The solos
were sung perfectly, and the choruses as well as the
orchestra likewise deserve praise. M. Gounod
directed in person the performance of his work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is plain that the pace of the young musician
was not that of an ordinary artist, and that his first
steps were directed toward glory, for rarely does
one hear such praise accorded a composer of
twenty-five years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile Gounod, already haunted by an idea
which was long to pursue him, had dreamed of
bidding farewell, not to his art, but to the world,
and had seriously considered taking ecclesiastic
orders. His mind possessed by this fancy, he had,
during the latter part of his stay at Rome, left the
villa Médécis, where at that time the French school
was established, and had retired to the seminary.
As soon as he returned to Paris, he entered as
precentor the Missions Etrangères, where he wore
the long robe and costume of the conventual house,
and his resolution seemed thenceforth so certain that
it was accepted as an accomplished fact. Indeed
a special sheet, the <cite><span lang="fr">Revue et Gazette Musicale</span></cite>,
published the following under date of Feb. 15,
1846: “M. Gounod, composer and former winner
of the grand Institute prize, has just taken orders.”
From this moment, Gounod was called “l’Abbé
Gounod,” just as, sixty years before, his master
Lesueur was called “l’Abbé Lesueur,” when he
became precentor of the Metropolitan church.
There was this difference, however, that Lesueur
had never desired to become a priest, but according
to the usage then in vogue at the Notre Dame
church, Paris, he was obliged, in order to fulfill the
functions of precentor, to don the priestly garb.
Gounod, on the other hand, seemed to have made
up his mind to a religious life, since in 1846 a
publisher brought out a series of religious choruses
entitled “Offices of Holy Week, by the Abbé Charles
Gounod.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In his retreat Gounod continued to occupy himself
with religious music, and in 1849 he had
performed at the Saint Eustache church a grand
solemn mass which was very well received. At
this moment he seemed absolutely lost to profane
art, and as he was brought very little before the
public, people began to forget about him, when
there appeared in the London Athenæum early in
1851, an article which was immediately republished
in the <cite><span lang="fr">Revue et Gazette Musicale</span></cite> of Paris, and
which contained an enthusiastic eulogium on several
of Gounod’s compositions recently performed at a
concert at St. Martin’s Hall. “This music,” said
the writer, “brings before us no other composer
ancient or modern, either by the form, the melody
or the harmony. It is not new in the sense of
being bizarre or whimsical; it is not old, if old
means dry and stiff, the bare scaffolding, with no
fine construction rising behind it; it is the work
of an accomplished artist, it is the poetry of a new
poet.&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;*&#160;* That the impression produced
upon the audience was great and real there
can be no doubt, but it is the music itself, not its
reception, which to our minds presages for M.
Gounod an uncommon career; for if there be not
in his works a genius at once true and new, then
must we go back to school and relearn the alphabet
of the art and of criticism.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This article fell like a thunderclap on Paris,
where people were scarcely giving Gounod a
thought. A very distinguished French musical
critic, Louis Viardot, was then in London with his
wife, the worthy and noble sister of Malibran.
This Athenæum article was attributed to him, not
without reason, I think, and it was soon known
that Mme. Viardot, whose experience, taste and
musical knowledge everyone knows, was struck by
the music of the young master, and that she was
far from concealing her admiration for a talent so
pure, so elegant and so exquisite.</p>

<p class='c007'>Excited by such a success Gounod at once
renounced his orders, and entered without more
delay upon the militant career of the art interrupted
for so many years. He soon produced in public a
pretty symphony in E flat, which, performed in a
remarkable manner by the Saint Cecilia Society,
then a worthy rival of that of the Conservatoire, won
him the congratulations and sincere encouragement
of the critics. Then, thanks to the assistance of
Mme. Viardot, he was charged with writing for the
<i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i> the score of a work in three acts, “Sapho,”
the libretto of which had been confided to a young
poet, Emile Angier, who was likewise in the
morning of his career, and likewise destined for
glory, and in this work the great artist whom we
have just named, was to take the principal rôle.
Notwithstanding all, “Sapho” was not well received
by the public, or at least only moderately so and
scarcely achieved more than what is called in France
a success of esteem. Yet the work was an exceedingly
good one, but the first step on a stage so
important as that of the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i> is so difficult for a
young composer to make! It must be said,
however, that if the work as a whole was not
judged entirely satisfactory, especially in regard to
the scenic effects, etc., it presented a value which a
fastidious critic stated in these terms: “The
opera of “Sapho,” without being a good dramatic
work, is the work of a distinguished musician who
has style and lofty tendencies. M. Gounod has
perfectly seized and happily rendered all the lyric
parts of the subject which he has treated, but he
has been less happy in trying to express the conflict
of passions and the contrast of characters.” Certain
pages in the score of “Sapho” were remarked as
being quite individual in flavor, and the public were
especially delighted with the beautiful song of the
young shepherd, “Brontez le Thym, Brontes mes
chêvres,” as well as the admirable couplets of
“Sapho,” of a character so melancholy, and an
inspiration so full of a delicate poetry. The work
was performed on the 16th of April, 1851.</p>

<p class='c007'>A year later the Comédie-Française produced a
tragedy by Pousard, “Ulysse,” for which Gounod had
written a number of beautiful choruses, redolent
with the perfume of antiquity and full of a manly
energy. Very soon the young composer appeared
again at the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i> with a grand work in five acts
called “La Nonne Sanglante,” the libretto of which,
although signed by the names of Scribe and Germain
Delavigne, was absolutely devoid of interest. He
made a mistake in accepting this libretto, previously
refused by several of his colleagues, among others
Meyerbeer and Halévy, and which could not excite
his inspiration. Notwithstanding some remarkable
bits, some vigorous and beautiful scenes, the score
of “La Nonne Sanglante” was really only secondary
in value, and the work achieved a very mild success
when it was produced Oct. 18, 1854, with Mlles.
Werthermber, Poinsot and Dameron, MM. Gueymard,
Depassio and Merly for interpreters. Its
career was short, and it only lived through eleven
performances. Gounod had not yet found his vein.</p>

<p class='c007'>But better fortune was in store for him, and after
a few years of silence he began the series of his
successes by giving to the <i><span lang="fr">Théâtre-Lyrique</span></i>, then
very flourishing and very brilliant under the
direction of M. Carvalho, “Le Médécin Malgré Lui.”
The libretto of this had been arranged for <i><span lang="fr">Opéra Comique</span></i>
by MM. Jules Barbier and Michel Carré,
who had preserved the greater part of Molière’s
prose. Although from a general point of view the
comic sentiment may not be the dominant quality
of his talent, yet that quality is far from lacking in
Gounod, as is proved by “Le Médécin Malgré Lui,”
which remains one of the most curious and most
original of his attempts. In this work, which was
performed Jan. 15, 1858, the composer revived
with a rare cleverness the old forms of French
music, while adding thereto the most ingenious and
most piquant artifices of the modern science, and
by clothing the whole with his masterly style he
produced a work of a very unique color, flavor and
character. “Le Médécin Malgré Lui,” which the
public received with marked favor, seemed to prepare
the great day of Gounod’s artistic life. Fourteen
months after the appearance of this work, that is to
say, on March 19, 1859, the composer gave to the
same theatre the work which was to establish his
fame upon a fixed basis. The reader of course
divines that I refer to “Faust,” that masterpiece
which can boast of such a brilliant, prolonged and
universal success, and which will remain, perhaps,
the author’s best title to the remembrance and
recognition of posterity.</p>

<p class='c007'>But let it not be supposed that the triumphal
career of “Faust” was not confronted at the outset
with difficulties and obstacles which appeared
insurmountable. When it was carried by the
authors to the <i><span lang="fr">Théâtre-Lyrique</span></i>, there was in preparation
at the Porte Saint Martin theatre another
drama built on Goethe’s poem, and bearing the
same name. M. Carvalho told Gounod that it
would be necessary to await the result of the “Faust”
at the Porte Saint Martin, for if that work won a
success, it would be very difficult and very hazardous
to offer another “Faust” to the public. So
they waited, and the drama not proving a success, it
was decided to proceed with the study of the opera.
Gounod’s “Faust” was presented in the form styled
in France <i><span lang="fr">Opéra Comique</span></i>, that is to say, the singing
parts being interspersed with spoken dialogue.
(It was not until later when “Faust” passed into
the repertoire of the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i> that this dialogue
was replaced by recitatives.) The rôle of Marguerite
was first given to Mme. Ugalde, but Mme.
Carvalho having expressed a desire to take the
rôle, after becoming acquainted with the music,
the authors transferred it to her and consoled Mme.
Ugalde by giving her the part of Mélodine in
Victor Massé’s opera, “La Fée Carabosse,” which
was being mounted at the same time. The rehearsals
of “Faust” were very laborious. M. Carvalho, disconcerted
by the new and daring character of the
music, and by the poetic sentiment revealed in it,
which he judged incompatible with stage requirements,
picked a quarrel with the composer, declared
his score too much developed, and constantly
demanded new cuts and changes. Gounod, made
uneasy by this lack of confidence, had yielded to
several of these demands and had already consented
to several suppressions, when at last M. Carvalho
came to him one day with a proposition to suppress
the beautiful final scene in the garden, fearing that
this quiet scene, with no outburst or noise of any
kind, would seem cold to the public and fail to
produce an effect. This time Gounod, who had
faith in his work and was conscious of its value,
stood fast and immovable, declaring he would
rather withdraw his score than to yield this point
and consent to such a sacrifice. In short, after a
whole series of combats and discussions of this sort,
which were renewed daily, the work was finally
brought out. Truth compels the confession that it
was not fully understood at first; that the critics
stood hesitating and undecided in the presence of
a work so new in form, and that the public itself
was of two minds regarding the value of the work,
some applauding with enthusiasm while others
harshly criticised. It is certain that the first
reception was more cold and reserved than could
have been desired, but gradually people began to
understand and appreciate the beauties abounding
in this exquisite score, and at last its success was
complete, brilliant and incontestable, spreading
first throughout France, then over Europe, then
over the entire world, where “Faust” is to-day, and
long has been, considered a great masterpiece, and
its author’s best work. “Faust” has been played in
all countries and translated into all languages. It
is one of the first French works which Italy, before
then so hostile and impenetrable to French music,
has applauded with a sort of furor. In Germany,
where for a number of years Spohr’s “Faust” reigned
supreme, it was received in a triumphal
manner, and completely dethroned the
latter. It excited enthusiasm, not only
in Vienna, Berlin, Dresden, Hamburg,
Baden, Leipsic, Frankfort, Stuttgart and
Darmstadt, not only in Milan, Rome,
Venice, Naples, Florence, Genoa, Parma
and Bologna, but in London, Moscow,
St. Petersburg, Varsovie, Copenhagen,
Stockholm, Brussels, Amsterdam, Madrid,
Barcelona, Lisbon, etc., and even finally
crossed the seas and became popular in
the two Americas. It is perhaps the first
work by a French composer which had
such a rapid, complete and universal
success. In Paris, “Faust” had been
played more than four hundred times
at the <i><span lang="fr">Théâtre-Lyrique</span></i> when the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i>
signified a desire to appropriate it. The
authors consented; but certain modifications
were necessitated by this change
of scene, and first of all the spoken dialogue
had to be suppressed and replaced
by recitatives. These changes effected,
the work made its appearance at the
<i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i> March 3, 1869, and there continued
its successful career, counting five
hundred performances in the space of
eighteen years. The five hundredth was
given on the 4th of November, 1887,
and the six hundredth took place in the
beginning of the year 1892, so that in
Paris alone, “Faust” has already reached
its thousandth performance. Such a
success is without parallel in the annals of the
theatre in France.</p>

<p>CHARLES GOUNOD.<br>  <br>  Reproduction of an engraving made from a photograph in 1859, about the time of the first production of Faust, Gounod being then in his forty-first year.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Gounod had borrowed “Le Médécin Malgré Lui”
from Molière; he had appropriated material from
Goethe’s “Faust;” it was La Fontaine who furnished
him the subject of a pretty opera, somewhat light in
character, called “Philémon et Baucis,” performed
at the <i><span lang="fr">Théâtre-Lyrique</span></i>, Feb. 18, 1860. The score of
“Philémon et Baucis” is a pleasant one, full of
charm, in which tenderness and grace alternates with
fun and buffoonery. The work, which was in three
acts, achieved only a moderate success at the
<i><span lang="fr">Théâtre-Lyrique</span></i>; its real success dates from its
transfer to the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra Comique</span></i>, reduced to two
acts. Since then it has never been taken from
the repertoire of that theatre. But soon Gounod
was to appear on the grand stage of the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i> with
a work of large proportions, “La Reine de Saba.”
Notwithstanding the fame which his previous works
had made for him, he was no more fortunate with
“La Reine de Saba” (Feb. 29, 1862) than he had
been with “La Nonne Sanglante.” It is true that
this time the trouble lay principally in the libretto
of his collaborators, which was absolutely devoid of
interest. For it is but just to say that if the score
of “La Reine de Saba” is of unequal merit and of
a secondary character, it nevertheless contains some
superb and exquisite pages, like the noble air of
Balkis, and the beautiful chorus of the Jewesses
and the Sabians. However, it only lived through
fifteen performances at Paris, though it should be
remarked that in certain foreign cities it was
received with great favor, and that in Brussels and
Darmstadt, among others, its success was considerable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gounod’s unfortunate attempts at the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i> led
him to turn his attention anew to the <i><span lang="fr">Théâtre-Lyrique</span></i>,
where he brought out, March 19, 1864, a
work entitled “Mireille,” the subject of which was
taken from a pretty provincial poem by Frederic
Mistral, bearing the same title, (Mireio). This
poem is an exquisite pastorale, written in that
provincial language at once so musical, so sweet
and harmonious, a language which is melody in
itself. Unhappily, the libretto which Gounod set to
music on this subject was badly chosen, being ill
adapted to the stage, and therefore militated against
the composer’s work, although the latter contained
some truly charming pages. The first act, particularly,
radiant with light and sunshine, is charmingly
poetic, and especially deserving of mention is the
beautiful chorus of the magnarelles and the touching
duet of Mireille and Vincent. The score
contains still other charming bits, such as Magali’s
beautiful song and Taven’s couplets: Voici la
saison, mignonne. However, the defective libretto
stood in the way of the success of the work, which
at first remained undecided. It was found necessary
to entirely rewrite the work, to make large
suppressions, and reduce it from five to three acts,
which did not result in its being any better received
by the public. It was not until later, when it was
transferred to the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra Comique</span></i> after having been
subjected to still further revisions and cast in its
final form, that “Mireille” at last found the success
which its incontestable musical value merited.
Thereafter, it never left the repertoire of that
theatre.</p>

<p class='c007'>No particular importance can be attached to a
little work in two acts, “La Colombe,” which Gounod
gave to the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra Comique</span></i> in 1866, and which he
had written some years before for the theatre at
Baden; it was a sort of salon operetta, without
special character or consequence. But the composer
was yet to carry off one of the most brilliant
victories of his career with “Roméo et Juliette”
which made its first appearance at the <i><span lang="fr">Théâtre-Lyrique</span></i>
on the 27th of April, 1867. More fortunate
than “Faust” and “Mireille,” whose success had
been so difficult to establish, “Roméo et Juliette”
was well received from the very outset, and this
superb score in which the passion of love and the
sentiment of chivalry are so happily united, immediately
found favor with the public. Nor has it ever
ceased to excite public sympathy, and it has
changed its biding-place from the <i><span lang="fr">Théâtre-Lyrique</span></i>
to the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra Comique</span></i>, and from that theatre to the
<i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i> without experiencing any diminution of public
interest. “Roméo et Juliette” has exceeded the
number of five hundred performances in Paris, one
hundred of which were at the <i><span lang="fr">Théâtre-Lyrique</span></i>,
about three hundred at the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra Comique</span></i> and
more than one hundred at the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i>. Outside of
France it has not been less successful, and it has
made a part of the repertoire of all the great
theatres of Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, “Roméo et Juliette” marks the culminating
point in the career of Gounod, who since
then has not been able to equal its success. In
1870 the master went to London where he remained
for several years, working and producing much.
There it was that he wrote, among other things, an
opera called “George Dandin,” to the prose of
Molière, which has not yet been performed; it was
there also that he wrote, for the Universal Exposition
at London in 1871, a grand cantata entitled
“Gallia,” which was performed later at Paris, where
it was very favorably received. A warm welcome was
also given to the music which Gounod wrote for
“Jeanne d’Arc,” a drama in verse by Jules Barbier
which was performed at the Gaiety on Nov. 8,
1873. This music consisted of melodramas,
interludes, choruses, etc., and contained some very
interesting pages. The preceding year the Ventadour
theatre had brought out a drama in verse by
Ernest Legouvé for which Gounod had written a
score of the same kind; this drama was called “Les
Deux Reines de France.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In these two works the music was merely an
accessory, and the composer was only the humble
servant of the poet, whom he discreetly aided and
supplemented. But Gounod had not given up the
idea of appearing again before the public as a true
dramatic musician. Ten years had elapsed since
he had given “Roméo et Juliette,” and the public
were growing impatient for a new work from him,
when in 1877 the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra Comique</span></i> announced the
performance of “Cinq-Mars.” This was an artistic
treat in which all Paris desired to participate, but
which did not wholly justify the hopes which it
had raised. The score of “Cinq-Mars” was certainly
far from being worthless; it was written in a musical
language that was superb and noble in style, but
aside from a few exquisite pages, it did not have
the freshness, the abundance and the generosity of
inspiration which had hitherto characterized
Gounod’s work. It was unequal, cold at intervals,
and one no longer felt that vigor of youth, that
warmth of accent which had made the triumph of
the master’s great productions. In a word “Cinq-Mars”
was received with sympathy but not enthusiasm,
and as soon as the novelty had passed it
disappeared without causing any disquietude.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The following year Gounod presented himself
again at the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i>. For a long time past he had
felt the desire to attempt one of the Corneille’s
masterpieces, and he had formed the plan of
setting “Polyeucte” to music, and transforming it into
a lyric drama. It was a subject half religious, half
profane, which seemed peculiarly suited to his
intellectual temperament. He charged his friend,
Jules Barbier, with fashioning a libretto from
Corneille’s celebrated tragedy, which the latter
followed step by step, even preserving some of the
great poet’s verses, and he wrote the music of this
new “Polyeucte,” which was performed at the
<i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i>, Oct. 7, 1878. But it was said that the author
of “Faust” and “Roméo,” both so successful at
the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i>, after having been born and bred elsewhere,
could never succeed at that theatre with a
work written expressly for it. “Polyeucte,” indeed,
was not well received, and scarcely deserved to be,
and its career ended with a series of twenty-nine
performances. The composer was not much more
fortunate with “Le Tribut de Zamora,” another work
which he gave to the <i><span lang="fr">Opéra</span></i>, April 1, 1881. This
work, however, had been staged with great splendor
and magnificence, the costumes and decorations
were very rich and elaborate, and what was still
more important, the two principal rôles were taken
by artists of the first rank, M. Lassalle and Mme.
Gabrielle Krauss, the latter especially being very fine
in the character of Xaïma. But nothing could
counteract the insipidity and insignificance of the
work, and notwithstanding the luxury brought to its
support, notwithstanding the incontestable talent of
its interpreters, “Le Tribut de Zamora” scarcely
lived through fifty performances. This was the last
dramatic effort of Charles Gounod, who seems
to-day to have finally given up the theatre, and
whose health has been steadily declining for a
number of years.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Gounod has not confined himself exclusively
to the theatre; his very remarkable fertility has
exercised itself in all directions, particularly in the
religious genre, so well suited to his nature.
Gounod’s religious compositions are very numerous,
and since he has renounced the stage he has
achieved some striking successes in oratorio. “La
Redemption,” (1882) a sacred trilogy, of which he
wrote the music and the French words, and “Mors
et Vita,” another sacred trilogy, the Latin text of
which he arranged himself from the Catholic liturgy
and the Vulgate, won for him triumphs which the
great merit of these beautiful compositions fully
justified. Since his youth Gounod has produced
a great number of sacred works, several of which
are of rare beauty, such as the “Messe des Orphéonistes”
(1853), the “Messe de Sainte Cécile”
(1855), a mass in C minor (1867), a mass of the Sacred
Heart (1876), a mass to the memory of Joan of
Arc (1887), a mass for two voices, a short mass in
C major, three solemn masses, two Requiem masses,
a “Stabat Mater,” a “Te Deum,” a hymn to Saint
Augustin, “Les Sept Paroles du Christ,” “Jésus sur
le lac de Tibériade,” a choral psalmody, “Tobie,”
a little oratorio, and a considerable number of
motets of different kinds.</p>

<p class='c007'>In profane music, and aside from the theatre,
Gounod has shown himself scarcely less fertile.
His two symphonies, (first in D, second in E flat)
and his “Temple de l’Harmonie,” cantata with
choruses, are all compositions of great merit. I
would mention also “Biondina,” a pretty little lyric
poem, and especially would I call attention to his
beautiful male choruses, and to his songs of which
he has written more than a hundred, and among
which are to be found veritable masterpieces of
poetry and sentiment, such as “Le Vallon,” “Le
Soir,” “Medjé,” “l’Envoi de Fleurs,” “Le Printemps,”
“La Prière du Soir,” “Venise,” etc. In
this style of composition Gounod’s repertoire is
varied, substantial and charming, and few French
writers have given us a note so personal and
original.</p>

<p class='c007'>In attempting to characterize the genius of
Gounod, and to determine the place which he
should occupy in the history of contemporaneous
art, it is necessary to consider principally “Faust”
and “Roméo et Juliette.” These are his two masterpieces,
and it is through these works that the
composer has truly revealed his personality and his
genius; it is through these works that his name has
become famous and will go down to posterity. It
is of these works, then, that we must demand
the secret of that powerful influence which Gounod
has exerted for more than a quarter of a century
over the art, over artists and over the public.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Although not performed until a year after “Le
Médécin Malgré Lui,” “Faust” was written first.
In this work the musician had been intelligently
served by his collaborators, who had taken from
Goethe’s masterpiece all that which pertained to
the action and to the dramatic passion, and left
judiciously alone all the psychological, philosophical
and metaphysical dissertations. The libretto was
admirably cut for the stage, varied in tone and
coloring, and contained a fair quota of that fantastic
element so effective on the stage and so well
liked by the public. And never was the musician
better inspired. The Kermesse scene is full of
warmth and sunshine; the garden scene is one of
an ethereal and enchanting poetry, and the words
of passion are by turns softly languishing or full of
an intense energy; the scene in the church, where
Mephistopheles, pursuing Marguerite even to the
very shades of the sanctuary, tries to arrest her
prayer, and prevent the unfortunate victim from
taking refuge in the Divine mercy, is stamped
with a rare feeling of grandeur, and reveals a
profoundly dramatic character. Finally, the episode
of the death of Valentine and his malediction of
Marguerite forms a pathetic and superb scene,
which, with its numerous and varied incidents is
surely one of the best of this remarkable work.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a singular thing that the two musicians
whose personal and original genius characterize in
some sort, from points of view otherwise very
different, the reform tendencies of the present
French school, should both fall upon these two great
masterpieces, “Faust” and “Roméo et Juliette,”
each interpreting them after his own manner and
according to his own temperament. It was Berlioz
who first conceived the idea of appropriating them,
and long before Gounod had dreamed of such a
thing, had given us “Roméo et Juliette” and his
“Damnation de Faust.” Comparison between the
works of these two artists is impossible, because of
the dissimilarity of their natures and aspirations.
In regard to “Faust,” however, we may say that
Berlioz, who did not make an opera of it, but a
grand musical legend, preserving thus one of the
peculiar characteristics of the original work, treated
especially the energetic and picturesque part of the
drama, whereas Gounod chose rather to reproduce
the love poetry, the exalted reverie and that mystic
and supernatural perfume which characterizes
Goethe’s poem. Although the charming Kermesse
scene in Gounod’s score, which is an episode apart
from the action, is very well executed, highly colored,
of a really exceptional musical interest, it
cannot be denied that in picturesque sentiment
Berlioz has singularly surpassed his rival in the
various and typical episodes of his “Damnation de
Faust,” the latin song of the students, the soldier’s
chorus, the Hungarian march, the ballet of the
sylphs, the military retreat, the chorus of the sylphs
and gnomes, etc. On the other hand, whatever is
tender and emotional, dreamy and poetic, has been
admirably treated by Gounod, and it is by certain
unobtrusive fragments, certain almost hidden passages
in his score that the hand of a master, the
inspiration of a poet is betrayed, that the man of
genius is revealed. Witness Marguerite’s response
to Faust as he approaches her at the entrance of
the chapel:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="fr">Non, monsieur, je ne suis demoiselle ni belle,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">Et je n’ai pas besoin qu’on me donne la main.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>or Marguerite’s reflection in her garden,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="fr">Je voudrais bien savoir quel était ce jeune homme,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">Si c’est un grand seigneur et comment il se nomme.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Not only are these two fragments perfect, finished,
exquisite, from a musical point of view, but they
exhale besides I know not what mysterious perfume.
They give the hearer so complete a perception of
the sentiment which Marguerite is fated to prove for
“Faust,” that they have, aside from the scenic
import, a kind of mystic and profound meaning
which seems impossible to translate into music, and
which strikes, nevertheless, the most indifferent
ears. It is this peculiar, we may say hitherto
unknown sense, which gives Gounod’s “Faust” its
true color, its character at once tender and dreamy,
mysterious and fascinating, melancholy and passionate,
and which assigns to it a place apart, a unique
place among the number of the most original works
of contemporary art. It is easy to see in this work
that Gounod’s intellectual tendencies, his youthful
sympathies, his leanings toward a religious and
monastic life, have not been without influence on
his musical temperament, and on the very nature of
his talent.</p>

<p class='c007'>If “Faust” is an exquisite work, “Roméo et
Juliette” is a superb one, of a grand and spirited
style, in which the external and material picture of a
chivalric world contrasts strikingly with the internal
analysis of a passionate love, constrained to conceal
itself from all eyes, yet from this very cause becoming
all the more powerful. If one wished to enter into
what might be called a psychological analysis of the
score, it would be necessary to discover how great
were the difficulties of the composer in writing
“Roméo” without repeating himself, after having
written “Faust.” For, although the subjects of the
two works differ widely, we see the same situations
reproduced in each, under the same scenic conditions,
and the stumbling block was all the more
troublesome since these situations were the most
salient ones, and constituted, as it were, the very
core of the dramatic action. Witness the balcony
scene of “Roméo” and the garden scene of “Faust”
or the duel of Roméo and Tybalt with the death of
the latter, in the first, and the duel of Faust and
Valentine, also mortal, in the second. Truly a
musician must have a singular power, a very
remarkable faculty of reiteration, to attempt successfully
such a repetition of similar episodes.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<p>GOUNOD IN HIS STUDY.<br>  <br>  Reproduction of a photograph from life made by Dornac &#38; Cie., Paris.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>And what scene so marvelous as that balcony
scene of Roméo, chaste and passionate throughout!
What earnest and trembling accents on the lips of
the two fond lovers whom the world—a world of
strife and contention—seems bound to separate
forever! And what newness, what a winning fearlessness,
what a balmy freshness in the melodic
sentiment which the composer employs to express
the sensations which stir the hearts of his tender
heroes! Could love be expressed in a more exquisite
and more touching manner?</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, and by contrast, what scene
more striking in its grandeur, more spirited, more
manly, than that of the double duel, Tybalt and
Mercutio, Roméo and Tybalt! Here the musician
has so wonderfully colored his inspiration that he
has raised up a world of the past before our very
eyes, and, while listening, we feel that surely we
must be present at one of the cruel episodes of that
long and bloody struggle between the Capulets and
the Montagues. The insult slung by Tybalt in
the face of Roméo, agitated, but contained,
Mercutio’s objurgations, the first duel of the
latter with Tybalt, who strikes him to the heart,
Roméo’s rage at seeing his friend expire, the fury
with which he throws himself in his turn upon
Tybalt, and the second combat, fatal to the latter,
all this the composer has rendered in an admirable
manner, with a spirit, a verve, a power, a dramatic
movement and a picturesque feeling which make of
this episode a page full of grandeur, and worthy to
compete with the painting of a Titian or of a
Veronese. In considering this remarkable score,
so rich from beginning to end and so varied in its
unity, we cannot pass over the austere and touching
marriage scene, the lark duo and the episode of the
death of the two lovers. Truly, it is a work of the
highest order, which yields in nothing to “Faust,”
and is perhaps superior to it in certain parts and
in certain ways.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is in “Faust” and “Roméo” that Gounod has
not only given the full measure of his genius, but has
made most conspicuous the true personal tendencies
of that genius and his own originality. It is there
that his musical phrase, so fascinating, so new in
form and characteristic in outline, is developed in
all its fullness and all its freedom. It is there that
his harmonies, so rich, so refined, so piquant, and
sometimes so unexpected, are the most abundantly
and happily displayed. It is there that his ingenious
instrumentation, full of color and grace and always
elegant, that transparent instrumentation we might
say, at the same time dignified and full, has embraced
those exquisite passages which always thrill
delicate and sensitive ears. It is there that passion
speaks a truly enchanting language, that emotion
attains the highest limits of its power, and it is the
aggregate of all these qualities which make the
master’s genius stand out in bold relief and which
shows it off in the most complete and striking
fashion.</p>

<p class='c007'>But if “Faust” and “Roméo” are worthy of so
much admiration, that does not mean that no importance
or sympathy should be attached to the composer’s
other works, which, though less perfect and less
lofty in character, are none the less deserving of the
most active appreciation on the part of the public
and of true artists. “Philémon et Baucis,” “Mireille,”
“Le Médécin Malgré Lui,” are productions of
unquestionable merit, and even in “Sapho” and “La
Reine de Saba,” weak and unequal as they undoubtedly
are, one may find pages of the rarest beauty.
It should be remarked that even in his least successful
works, what we may always admire in Gounod
is the noblesse of his language and the splendor of
his style. It is necessary to add that if, as is generally
believed, fertility is a sign of force, Gounod deserves
to be classed among the strongest! Few artists,
indeed, have produced more or in greater variety,
opera, oratorio, symphony, religious music, cantatas,
vocal chamber music, (set to French, English or
Italian words) choruses with or without accompaniment,
compositions for piano or organ, he has
touched them all, and in all has given proof of the
most substantial and brilliant qualities.</p>

<p class='c007'>A very convincing proof of the power of Gounod’s
personality is the influence which he has exerted
for more than quarter of a century on the young
French school of music. The author of Faust has
brought into the art a note entirely new and
unknown before him. This dreamy, poetic note is
stamped with a grace and melancholy which characterizes
all of Gounod’s work, and vainly have
young musicians sought to reproduce and tried their
best to imitate the methods of a master whose
genius they did not possess, and who remained for
them inimitable. Nevertheless, this influence of
Gounod is the sign and the proof of his creative
power.</p>

<p class='c007'>One could scarcely pass over, in speaking of such
an artist, his literary proclivities, and the desire
which he manifested on different occasions to set
forth his ideas and the principles which he professed
in matters of art. All French musicians of the
present period are afflicted with a mania for writing.
Not only great artists like Reyer and Saint-Saëns,
following the example of Berlioz, Halévy and
Adolpe Adam, undertake to criticise and make
themselves the judges of their colleagues, but the
most inconsequential composer of operettas gives
himself to-day the airs of a writer, and believes
himself called upon to deliver himself of long esthetic
and philosophic discussions on the art of which
he deems himself one of the noblest representatives.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gounod has not escaped the general contagion.
It is only just to state, however, that he
has not abused his pen in this connection, and that
usually it has been occasion, rather than preconceived
desire, that has caused him to take it up.
The most important writing which we owe to
Gounod is the remarkable volume which he has
published under the title of “Le ‘Don Juan’ de
Mozart,” in which he expresses very clearly his
profound admiration for the master, of whom he
declares himself to be one of the most ardent,
respectful and faithful of disciples. In addition to
this Gounod has given to various journals or
periodicals some articles of running criticism or of
musical philosophy (“De la Routine en Matière
d’Art,” “Le Public,” “La Critique,” “Les Compositeurs
Chefs d’Orchestre,” “La Propriété
Artistique,” “l’Enseignement,” “La Critique
Musicale Anglaise,” “Les Pères de l’Eglise de la
Musique,” etc.) He has also given an interesting
preface to the volume of “Lettres Intimes” by
Berlioz, and he has published a preface intended to
accompany his score of “George Dandin,” a score
which has not yet seen the light and perhaps never
will. He enumerated and discussed in this curious
preface the reasons which led him to set prose to
music—and what prose! That of Molière; in
other words, the most compact, substantial and
solid prose which it is possible to imagine. Some
years since a report was spread abroad that Gounod
was preparing a book in which he would refute the
doctrines and theories of Richard Wagner. I do
not know whether he really ever conceived such a
project, but if he did I regret that he did not put
it in execution. For it seems to me that whatever
might be his ideas on this subject it would be an exceedingly
interesting thing, to have an artist like Gounod
express his opinions on an artist like Wagner.</p>

<p class='c007'>I return to Gounod the composer. However
little enthusiasm his detractors—for he has them—may
feel for his genius, they are none the less
obliged to confess that genius, and the power and
influence exerted by him upon the public—a public
which everywhere, in all the countries of the world,
has applauded his works. The artists who are
sharply discussed are usually the ones who possess
true worth. More noble than majestic, more
tender than pathetic, more pensive than enthusiastic,
more deliberate than spontaneous, the immense
talent of the author of “Faust” glitters with a multitude
of rare qualities, and in that talent one may
almost say that study, constant and indefatigable
study, has as great a part as inspiration. Not only
is Gounod a fine man of letters, well versed in the
knowledge of the languages and of masterpieces,
but, from a musical point of view, few artists have,
like him, been nourished by the marrow of lions.
There is no great musician whom Gounod does not
know, as it were, by heart, and he has only enthusiastic
admiration for the old masters. It was he,
who, listening one day at the Conservatoire to
Beethoven’s Choral Symphony, ran up to a friend
and cried, his face all aglow and wildly waving the
score, “It is the Bible of the musician!” On
another occasion when, at a certain salon, conversation
fell on music, and the proper rank of the
different musicians was under discussion, he delivered
himself of the following sentiment. “If the
greatest masters, Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, could
be annihilated by an unheard-of cataclysm, as the
painters might be by fire, it would be easy to
reconstruct all the music with Bach. In the
firmament of art, Bach is a nebula which has not
yet condensed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I have said that study is almost as great a part as
inspiration in the talent of Gounod, which may be
said of all truly superior artists; one might add that
this talent acquired a very individual color from the
alliance of the artist’s almost mystic sentiments with
a very keen comprehension of the human passions
and the storms of the heart. There has remained
by Gounod a sort of recollection of his first years
vowed by him to theological studies and of his
leaning toward a monastic life and the seclusion of
the cloister; possibly it is this which characterizes
his genius in such a special way, which gives it its
originality, its peculiar and its exceptional flavor,
although it is difficult to determine with precision
how much his artistic personality gained and how
much it lost by the influence of the ideas and
aspirations of his youth upon his later imagination.</p>

<p class='c007'>Musically and dramatically Gounod is more of a
spiritualist than materialist, more poet than painter,
more elegiac and vigorous than deeply pathetic;
this is perhaps the reason that some have pronounced
him lacking in dramatic sense. In this
they are mistaken, for it is not dramatic sense,
that is to say, impassioned perception, which
sometimes fails Gounod; it is, properly speaking,
temperament. But after all is said, the author of
“Faust,” of “Mireille” and of “Roméo” remains a
true poet, an inspired creator, an artist of the first rank,
and if not one of those who illumine the world with
a dazzling light, at least one of those who charm it,
who touch it, who make it listen and make it think,
His part is a sufficiently beautiful one, with which
he may well be satisfied.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Publishers’ Note.</span>—Since the foregoing was written, the death of Charles Gounod has been announced.
On October 16, 1893, he was stricken with apoplexy, and lingered until the 18th. He died at
St. Cloud, and was buried in the family vault at Auteuil.</p>
